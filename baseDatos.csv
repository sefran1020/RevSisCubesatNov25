The paper presented a novel design of a hybrid patch/spiral antenna. The antenna consists of four concentric rectangular patches with a spiral internal antenna. The proposed antenna is characterised by its compact size, lightweight, low cost, and at the same time, covers multi bands that fulfil L, S, C, X, Ku, K, and Ka bands. The antenna is suitable for CubeSat applications. Thanks to the low coupling between antennas, it is easier to design both antennas separately. The performance of the antenna is more reliable as its two subsystems do not affect each other, and it is a versatile design. The measured and simulated results reveal accepted coincidences with each other.

Designing a CubeSat antenna at the lower end of the UHF spectrum is a challenging task. There are too many constraints, and the designer cannot enhance one aspect of the antenna without seriously compromising another. The specifications lead inevitably to the implementation of an electrically small antenna. It would be highly desirable to be able to implement an electrically large antenna (2ka >), or even a resonant-size antenna (12 ka<<). Such a radiator would have significantly better performance, and it would aid the link budget with its higher gain. The need for higher gain becomes evident if we consider that the path loss for a CubeSat is about 140 dB. However, since the outer dimensions of CubeSats are fixed, this would be possible only if the system switched to higher frequencies (e.g. 0.9 or 2.4 GHz) (p. 5);Simulation results for resonance, matching, radiation patterns, and efficiency (p. 3);"Not mentioned; Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) (p. 3); Finite Integration Technique (FIT) (p. 3); Transient Solver for full-wave E/M simulation (p. 3)";CubeSat picosatellites (p. 1);Design and simulation of a microstrip patch antenna with tapered peripheral slits (p. 1);Design and simulation study (p. 1);"The maximum directivity is 4.9 dBi, but the low efficiency results in a maximum gain of 0.7 dBi (p. 4); Not mentioned; The antenna achieves a 2:1 VSWR bandwidth of 2 MHz and a 3:1 VSWR bandwidth of 4 MHz (p. 3); The front-to-back ratio is 5 dB, and the beamwidth is 116° on both principal planes (p. 4)";"Not mentioned; The total efficiency of the antenna varies between 29 – 33% throughout the service band (p. 4); The maximum gain of the antenna varies between 0.7 – 1.4 dB throughout the service band (p. 4)";The antenna design achieves significant miniaturization while maintaining acceptable performance, making it suitable for CubeSat applications (p. 4);"limitation_type: Bandwidth | description: The antenna is narrowband, with a 2:1 VSWR bandwidth of only 2 MHz (p. 3); limitation_type: Efficiency | description: The low efficiency results in a maximum gain of only 0.7 dBi (p. 4); limitation_type: Not mentioned | description: Not mentioned";"satellite antennas; polarization; UHF antennas; Not mentioned; Current distribution; microstrip antennas";"Kakoyiannis, C.
