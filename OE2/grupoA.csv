The paper presented a novel design of a hybrid patch/spiral antenna. The antenna consists of four concentric rectangular patches with a spiral internal antenna. The proposed antenna is characterised by its compact size, lightweight, low cost, and at the same time, covers multi bands that fulfil L, S, C, X, Ku, K, and Ka bands. The antenna is suitable for CubeSat applications. Thanks to the low coupling between antennas, it is easier to design both antennas separately. The performance of the antenna is more reliable as its two subsystems do not affect each other, and it is a versatile design.
