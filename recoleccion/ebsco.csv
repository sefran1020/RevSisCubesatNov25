SIW slot array antennas have advantages for CubeSat applications due to their low radiation loss, low transmission loss, and high isolation characteristics. However, these antennas have narrow bandwidth characteristics due to high Q factor. To compensate for this, the additional resonance mode TM10 of the metasurface superstrate has been used. An SIW slot array antenna without metasurface superstrate has dimensions of 23.5 mm×67.5 mm×0.675 mm(0.37λ0×1.05λ0×0.01λ0, λ0 at 4.67 GHz), bandwidth of 4.65～4.69 GHz (approximately 1 %), and maximum realization gain of 4.7 dBi.

It is a challenging to design an antenna with the limited space of a CubeSat platform. To improve the space utilization, an antenna is designed inspired by the concept of structure reuse. A meshed-like-structure is designed, which works as the radiator of a microstrip antenna at UHF band. However, it works as a partial reflective sheet for a Fabry–Perot resonator cavity antenna at C-band. Therefore, a microstrip patch antenna and a Fabry–Perot resonator cavity antenna share only single aperture. A shaped ground is used to decrease the resonance at the lower band. Then, the aperture of the antenna is only 0.3łambda _0 \,\times \, 0.3łambda _0 , which makes it easy to integrate with a 1U CubeSat.

Unlike a conventional perturbation which is etched only on one side, the arrow‐shaped slot perturbation of the proposed antenna is divided into two diagonal half‐arrows and etched on both the top and bottom side. Consequently, the counter‐clockwise rotation of electric surface currents at the radiator side for right‐handed circular polarization and the clockwise rotation of those at the ground side for left‐handed circular polarization are successfully achieved. The measurement results of the proposed antenna show good agreement with the simulations of reflection coefficients, axial ratios, antenna gains, and radiation patterns.","2018","2025-11-07 22:19:19","2025-11-07 22:19:19","","2018-2022","","8","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CubeSats (Artificial satellites); Microstrip antennas; Perturbation theory; Polarization (Electricity); Slot antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nanosatellite and CubeSats have very limited volume and surfaces bringing a physical size constraint on the components and antennas which should also be as functional as their counterparts used in similar terrestrial systems. The proposed structure is a cavity-backed antenna with tapered crossed-slot aperture. The antenna is a low-profile compared to wavelength, circularly polarized and wide-band with respect to conventional high-Q printed antennas. Two different designs to operate at 2.44 GHz are implemented on two different substrates, occupying a footprint of 38 mm × 38 mm and 30 mm × 30 mm. Their measured percentage impedance bandwidths are 2% and 1.68%, respectively. The obtained maximum gain is about 5 dBic around the target frequency. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The second application is the optimization of a non-uniformly spaced planar array composed of isotropic radiators installed on an 8-U nanosatellite. Finally, the optimization of a 3×3 planar antenna array for beam steering with simultaneous side lobe level control is described, whereby the beamforming coefficients were allowed to assume only discrete values.

Their compact size, lightweight, and simple fabrication method make CP antennas suitable for small satellite systems. The slot antenna has wideband impedance, but the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) is narrower compared to the impedance bandwidth (IBW).

For past: using transparent metal and using a wire mesh design. The transparent metal indium tin oxide has a comparatively high sheet impedance, which makes an antenna design less efficient. Also, there is a tradeoff between conductivity and transparency [6]. However, a highly conductive thin mesh structure has demonstrated a reasonable efficiency and a high transparency [7].
