The antenna design evolves through successive stages, integrating corner truncations, a slit-ring structure, and segment-circular parasitic patches to enhance impedance matching and polarization performance. In its final configuration, a dual-stacked arrangement with inter-substrate spacing and a vertical capacitive feed further improves current distribution symmetry and broadens the operational bandwidth. Parametric analysis validates the effectiveness of each antenna design refinement, demonstrating improvements in impedance bandwidth, axial ratio bandwidth, and gain performance. The fabricated prototype achieves a wide impedance bandwidth from 1.65 GHz to 2.70 GHz, fully encompassing the CubeSat uplink (2.025–2.110 GHz) and downlink (2.200–2.290 GHz) frequency ranges. It maintains an axial ratio below 3 dB across 1.97 GHz to 2.32 GHz, ensuring efficient circular polarization. Additionally, a stable gain of approximately 7.50 dBic at 2.025 GHz supports reliable communication with ground stations. The combination of compact structure, low profile, and wideband circular polarization makes the proposed antenna a promising candidate for CubeSat communication systems. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of a corner-truncated patch, symmetrically loaded segment-circular parasitic elements, and a circular slit-ring capacitive feed within a dual-stacked substrate configuration to achieve wideband circular polarization and stable unidirectional radiation.","2025-12-01","2025-11-07 22:09:02","2025-11-07 22:09:02","","107825","","","28","","Results in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capacitive feed; Circular polarization; Parasitic-loaded; S-band applications; Slit-ring structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the Space Weather Atmospheric Reconfigurable Multiscale-EXperiment (SWARM-EX), this issue is magnified by the mission’s ambitious goals; to comply with mission requirements, a SWARM-EX spacecraft is required to concurrently (1) point the science instruments no more than 30° off ram when they are operational, (2) point the GPS patch antenna no more than 30° off zenith at least once per orbit, (3) point the boresight of the X-Band patch antenna no more than 18° from the ground station during downlink, (4) maximize the differential cross-sectional area during differential drag maneuvers, and (5) maximize solar array power generation at all times. Consequently, leading-edge CubeSat missions like SWARM-EX require innovative systems engineering solutions to remain power-positive during on-orbit operations. Through the design of a comprehensive module-based concept of operations, orbital power generation simulations, intricate constrained attitude profiles, and a configurable battery state of charge simulation tool, the SWARM-EX mission designers have conceived a plan to retire the risk of not maintaining a power-positive state while successfully meeting all mission requirements; it is the aim of the authors to illuminate these strategies as a case study.","2025-05-01","2025-11-07 22:09:02","2025-11-07 22:09:02","","6847-6862","","9","75","","Advances in Space Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Constrained attitude profiles; CubeSat; Power budget; Small satellites; SWARM-EX; Systems engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technical objective of the mission is achieving 1km/s of delta-V over a 1 year mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This will be accomplished using a novel electric propulsion system, the Diverging Cusped Field Thruster (DCFT), which enables high efficiency orbital changes of the ESPA-ring class satellite. CASTOR is capable of improving rapid access to space capabilities by providing an orbital transfer platform with a very high performance to mass ratio, thus greatly reducing launch costs and allowing for highly efficient orbital manoeuvre. Furthermore, CASTOR is highly scalable and modular, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of scales and applications. CASTOR is developed as part of the University Nanosatellite Program (UNP) funded by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). In order to accomplish CASTOR mission objective, a highly optimized, scalable, light weight, and low cost communication system needed to be developed. These constraints imply the development of trade studies to select the final communication system architecture able to maximize the amount of data transmitted, while guaranteeing reliability, redundancy and limited mass, power consumption, and cost. A special attention is also required to guarantee a reliable communication system in cases of tumbling, or in case of strong Doppler shift which is inevitable due to the high delta-V capabilities of the vehicle. In order to accomplish all the mission requirements, different features have been introduced in the design of the communication system for this mission. Specifically, customized patch antennas have been realized, and a customized communication protocol has been designed and implemented. The communication subsystem has been validated through an intense testing campaign which included software tests in the laboratory, hardware tests in anechoic chamber, and in flight tests through a balloon experiment. The article presents an overview of CASTOR mission, a presentation of the trade studies analysis and of the final communication architecture selected, a description of the customized antenna developed, of the customized protocol designed, and a presentation of the results of the tests performed.","2012-12-01","2025-11-07 22:09:02","2025-11-07 22:09:02","","111-121","","1","81","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antennas; Communication protocol; Communication systems; Electric propulsion; ESPA ring satellite; Link analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart panel technology that provides both mechanical and electrical functionality is a beneficial solution to spacecraft miniaturization. Combining different subsystems that are usually developed independently of each other is an innovative approach to space system design. Embedding antennas within satellite structural components reduces the overhead required for integrating numerous systems and maximizes space for the payload and other critical instruments. Microstrip patch antennas provide a low profile, light weight, small-dimension and easily manufactured solution to small satellite communication. The phased array functionality of the antenna enables dynamic beamforming for maximum versatility. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of an embedded phased array microstrip patch antenna with a hybrid composite structural panel comprised of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite (CFC), Polyethylene fiber reinforcedpolyethylene composite (PFC) (HDPE), and aluminium, with SU-8 as the antenna substrate. The embedded antenna panels are designed to be adaptable for any function and size required by the end user. We present the design of the smart panel antenna modelled using electromagnetic simulation software. The CFC and PFC materials are modelled with approximations of their electrical properties derived from experimental S-parameter and impedance measurements. The simulated antenna's radiation performance such as half power beamwidth, efficiency and gain are evaluated. The performance characteristics of the simulated antenna design are used to evaluate its application and feasibility in systems integration, and different uses in case studies including radar mapping spacecraft, satellite constellations, and CubeSats.","2020-10-01","2025-11-07 22:09:02","2025-11-07 22:09:02","","51-56","","","175","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antennas; Communications; Composites; CubeSats; Multifunctional structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, moving from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or further, the communication systems currently implemented will not be able to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks in small spacecraft communication systems is represented by antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Current antennas for CubeSats are mostly dipole or patch antennas with limited gain. Deployable (not inflatable) antennas for CubeSats are currently being investigated, but these solutions are affected by the challenge of packaging the whole deployable structure in a small spacecraft. The work that we propose represents the first attempt to develop an inflatable antenna for CubeSats. Inflatable structures and antennas can be packaged efficiently occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. Inflatable antennas have been previously tested in space (Inflatable Antenna Experiment, STS-77). However they have never been developed for small spacecraft such as CubeSats, where the packaging efficiency, the deployment, and the inflation represent a challenge. Our study explores for the first time the possibility of developing such antenna in a way compatible with CubeSat dimensions and constraints. The research provides answers on the possible dimensions for an inflatable antenna for small satellites, on the gain and resolution that can be achieved, and on the deployment and inflation mechanism compatible with CubeSat. Future work in the development of the antenna will include the test of the antenna in flight during a specific technical demonstration mission. The article is structured as follows: context and motivation for Cubesat inflatable antenna are described; then a study to design the antenna which achieves the required performance metrics, while respecting the constraints imposed by CubeSat structure, is presented.","2013-10-01","2025-11-07 22:09:02","2025-11-07 22:09:02","","322-332","","","91","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antenna; Communication systems; CubeSat; Inflatable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NEXTSat-2 (Next-Generation Satellite II) is a small radar satellite primarily aimed at demonstrating locally developed SAR technology. it also serves additional purposes, including the verification of core space technologies and the measurement of space radiation. The satellite, having a total mass of 180 kg, was built for X-band SAR with the center frequency of 9.65 GHz and a look angle of 20∼35°. It can produce SAR imagery with the resolution of 5m and the swath of 40 km in StripMap mode. It can provide the power capacity of 36 Ah, the pointing accuracy of 0.04° (3σ), the payload data transmit rate of 320 Mbps, and the data storage of 384 Gbit. The X-band SAR instrument comprises a compact SAR Central Unit, a Power Supply & Distribution Unit, deployable antennas, and Transmit/Receive Modules. The X-band SAR employs a simple and low-cost antenna system while offering large-deployable capability.

However, there are still populated areas which are not covered by ground-based telecommunications infrastructure. This is where telecommunication satellite constellations come in, as they can provide coverage to remote and uninhabited regions and fill existing connectivity gaps to ensure data transfer. LoRa is one of the technologies designed for data transmissions over long distances with low power consumption. Alongside with other technologies of the Low-Power Wide Area Network family, it is widely used for Internet of Things applications. LoRa chirp spread spectrum modulation is robust against the Doppler frequency shifts encountered in low earth orbits, and it has already been used in IoT satellite communications. Due to the low transmitted signal power, the achieved data rate is not high, making it a suitable technology for telecommunications payloads on CubeSat platforms for messaging services. As compared to existing traditional communication satellite systems, CubeSat constellations are low-cost and may offer an affordable connectivity service to developing regions. This study is divided in two parts. In Part I the demand model is built based on the population distribution not covered by cell towers. The LoRa link performance is analyzed, considering the impact of LoRa channel parameters variation, such as spreading factor and channel bandwidth, while satellite orbital height, transmission antenna beamwidth, and transmitter peak power have a direct impact on the payload mass. Among thousands of possible configurations, 73 feasible payload designs have been downselected. In Part II of the study, the satellite mass and the total system cost are estimated based on the payload parameters obtained. Messages transmission simulation via a constellation is conducted in order to identify optimal constellation architectures for messaging service, as well as the main drivers of the system economic profitability. The presented analysis results provide a deeper understanding of LoRa connectivity advantages and limitations together with the performance drivers, which will support the optimization of future LoRa-based satellite communication systems and other IoT satellite constellations.","2024-10-01","2025-11-07 22:09:03","2025-11-07 22:09:03","","525-539","","","223","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Internet of Things; LoRa technology; Messaging service; Satellite communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a single-frequency, single-station RTK relative navigation system specifically designed for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and adapted from ground-based RTK systems. To achieve precise relative navigation, we analyze the statistical characteristics of integer ambiguity in carrier-phase measurements, starting with pseudorange-based differential GPS relative navigation. Instead of using the conventional extended Kalman filter, we introduce a recursive ambiguity filter based on weighted least squares, improving the float solution for ambiguity estimation without requiring complex filter designs. By deriving the statistical characteristics and the spatial metric known as ambiguity dilution of precision, we establish a strategy to achieve a 100 % success-fix rate in integer ambiguity resolution, utilizing the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment method for RTK relative navigation. The proposed algorithm's reliability is validated through software-based LEO simulators and ground-based experimental hardware that uses GPS receivers and patch antennas mounted on the SNUGLITE-III CubeSat. This approach enables centimeter-level relative navigation using only commercial off-the-shelf hardware and GPS receivers on CubeSat platforms. Furthermore, the proposed method improves success-fix rates for integer ambiguity resolution and significantly reduces computational complexity.","2025-11-01","2025-11-07 22:09:03","2025-11-07 22:09:03","","1181-1197","","","236","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
