The antenna incorporates parasitic elements to enhance its performance, focusing on improving both gain and impedance matching. The proposed design aims to achieve optimal resonance and operational efficiency within the X-band frequency range. Specifically, the resonant frequency of the antenna is tuned to 8.15 GHz, making it suitable for applications in satellite communication and weather monitoring systems. The design features a 1x2 patch antenna array, which has been optimized to provide a high gain of 11.8 dB at the resonant frequency of 8.15 GHz. This performance is attributed to the inclusion of parasitic elements that effectively boost the antenna’s directivity and overall efficiency. Additionally, the antenna exhibits favorable impedance matching characteristics, with a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of 1.4054 and a reflection coefficient of −15.4295 dB at the operating frequency. These results demonstrate that the proposed antenna is well-suited for CubeSat applications, where high gain and low reflection are critical for reliable communication and data transmission. The combination of high gain, efficient impedance matching, and strong resonant performance at 8.15 GHz makes this antenna design a promising solution for next-generation CubeSat communication systems and weather monitoring platforms operating in the X-band. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2026","2025-11-07 22:06:11","2025-11-07 22:06:11","","279-289","","","2612 CCIS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

We propose a single-frequency, single-station RTK relative navigation system specifically designed for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and adapted from ground-based RTK systems. To achieve precise relative navigation, we analyze the statistical characteristics of integer ambiguity in carrier-phase measurements, starting with pseudorange-based differential GPS relative navigation. Instead of using the conventional extended Kalman filter, we introduce a recursive ambiguity filter based on weighted least squares, improving the float solution for ambiguity estimation without requiring complex filter designs. By deriving the statistical characteristics and the spatial metric known as ambiguity dilution of precision, we establish a strategy to achieve a 100 % success-fix rate in integer ambiguity resolution, utilizing the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment method for RTK relative navigation. The proposed algorithm's reliability is validated through software-based LEO simulators and ground-based experimental hardware that uses GPS receivers and patch antennas mounted on the SNUGLITE-III CubeSat. This approach enables centimeter-level relative navigation using only commercial off-the-shelf hardware and GPS receivers on CubeSat platforms. Furthermore, the proposed method improves success-fix rates for integer ambiguity resolution and significantly reduces computational complexity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:11","2025-11-07 22:06:11","","1181-1197","","","236","","Acta Astronaut","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

This work proposes a complementary configuration of traditional patch-coupled LWAs based on the Babinet-duality theory, incorporating perforated patch arrays on a dielectric substrate to reduce weight. By integrating complementary spoof surface plasmon polaritons (C-SSPPs) as the waveguide, coupled feeding to the perforated patches is realized. The frequency-dependent phase difference across the patches enables sectoral beam scanning from backward to forward, demonstrating typical LWA behavior. Experimental results show continuous backward-to-forward scanning over −59° to +25° across 4.5–9.5 GHz.

Recently small satellites have become more attractive even in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) applications due to their low cost of development and enhanced capability. The NEXTSat-2 (Next-Generation Satellite II) is a small radar satellite primarily aimed at demonstrating locally developed SAR technology. it also serves additional purposes, including the verification of core space technologies and the measurement of space radiation. The satellite, having a total mass of 180 kg, was built for X-band SAR with the center frequency of 9.65 GHz and a look angle of 20∼35°. It can produce SAR imagery with the resolution of 5m and the swath of 40 km in StripMap mode. It can provide the power capacity of 36 Ah, the pointing accuracy of 0.04° (3σ), the payload data transmit rate of 320 Mbps, and the data storage of 384 Gbit. The X-band SAR instrument comprises a compact SAR Central Unit, a Power Supply & Distribution Unit, deployable antennas, and Transmit/Receive Modules. The X-band SAR employs a simple and low-cost antenna system while offering large-deployable capability. The antenna is based on the rugged microstrip patch antenna array, which enables low-cost and easy fabrication. This SAR antenna system provides a radiating area of 5.2 m × 0.55 m, consisting of a total of 5 mechanical panels and 14 electrical subarray antennas. The NEXTSat-2 has been operating on a dawn-dusk orbit with 550 km altitude since its launch at Naro Space center, Korea, by the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-II (KSLV-II), in May 2023. Through on-orbit demonstration, the quality parameters of NEXTSat-2 X-band SAR were measured and the pointing calibration was performed to improve the zero-Doppler characteristics. From the SAR images, it is shown that the NEXTSat-2 can provide medium-resolution radar images to meet the needs of identifying and monitoring natural anomalies on a larger scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:11","2025-11-07 22:06:11","","55-68","","","235","","Acta Astronaut","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.S.

This paper presents a design of an X-band microstrip patch antenna using an electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure for CubeSat applications. The X-band is preferred for CubeSat missions in high-speed communication, long distance or deep space because it allows communication at higher data rates, and the antenna is smaller than those used for lower frequency bands. In our study, the EBG elements are analyzed, modified and optimized so that the antenna can fit a 10 cm × 10 cm surface area of a standard 3U CubeSat structure while providing a significant high gain and circular polarization (CP). A noticeable point of this research is that the simplicity of the antenna and the EBG structure are being maintained by just using a simple single-probe feed to achieve a total antenna efficiency exceeding 90%, and the measured gain of around 11.7 dBi at the desired frequency of 8.483 GHz. Furthermore, the measured axial ratio (AR) is around 1.4 dB at 8.483 GHz, which satisfied the lower-than-3 dB requirement for CP antennas in general.

For the Space Weather Atmospheric Reconfigurable Multiscale-EXperiment (SWARM-EX), this issue is magnified by the mission's ambitious goals; to comply with mission requirements, a SWARM-EX spacecraft is required to concurrently (1) point the science instruments no more than 30° off ram when they are operational, (2) point the GPS patch antenna no more than 30° off zenith at least once per orbit, (3) point the boresight of the X-Band patch antenna no more than 18° from the ground station during downlink, (4) maximize the differential cross-sectional area during differential drag maneuvers, and (5) maximize solar array power generation at all times. Consequently, leading-edge CubeSat missions like SWARM-EX require innovative systems engineering solutions to remain power-positive during on-orbit operations. Through the design of a comprehensive module-based concept of operations, orbital power generation simulations, intricate constrained attitude profiles, and a configurable battery state of charge simulation tool, the SWARM-EX mission designers have conceived a plan to retire the risk of not maintaining a power-positive state while successfully meeting all mission requirements; it is the aim of the authors to illuminate these strategies as a case study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","6847-6862","","9","75","","Adv.

A distinctive feature of the antenna is its compact design, ease of fabrication, and low cost, which are made possible by the advantages of TPU filaments that can be produced using a 3D printer. The antenna can be mounted on the tip of the nanosatellite together with the camera, providing space for solar panels or other equipment without using additional space in the side areas. Given the limited dimensions of CubeSats, our antenna makes efficient use of the surface. The antenna operates in the S, C, X, Ku, K, and Ka bands and achieves gains of 6.31, 4.08, 9.97, 7.06, 7.12, and 8.22 dBi, respectively; the reflection coefficient is much lower than −10 dB, and the VSWR value is below 1.5. In summary, the microstrip patch antenna system proposed in this work can be used in similar CubeSat remote sensing applications, offering excellent performance, reliability, simplicity, and compact dimensions in the fabrication and deployment system. In the future, we plan to perform fabrication and space environment testing of the proposed antenna, such as vibration, thermal vacuum cycling, and thermal shock. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","2","100","","Phys Scr","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Physics","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.A.

The purpose of the satellite payload is to support national security initiatives, advance space exploration, monitor the Earth, collect scientific data, or provide communication services, it is specifically designed to meet these goals. A transponder (Communication device) is responsible for establishing a communication link with the ground station. Ground Station is a basic communication element that receives data/signal transmitted by the transponder of the satellite. In the project, we proposed to build a student-level Ground Station to receive data from source Satellites such as Weather satellites and ISS (International Space Station). A Ground Station is a terrestrial radio station that is designed for extra-planetary and other Satellite communication purposes. The Ground Stations communicate with spacecraft by transmitting and receiving radio waves in VHF (30 to 300 MHz) and UHF (300 MHz to 3 GHz). The major components that are involved in building a Ground Station are SDR, Raspberry Pi, Antenna. There are many antennas used for receiving a signal such as the Yagi-Uda antenna, Patch antenna, Log-Periodic antenna, Helical antenna, and V-Dipole antenna. In this project, a Log periodic antenna that works at 100 MHz to 500 MHz is proposed to receive the signals from NOAA-15 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) [1] at the frequency of 162.400–162.550 MHz for broadcasting weather information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","33-41","","","601","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

In 2014, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities. One of the critical thrusts was the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 m, 35 GHz antenna in a 1.5U canister. At that time, there had been minimal development in high-gain CubeSat antennas, critical for high-data-rate communications and remote sensing science. A Ka-band high-gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. This paper discusses designing, building, integrating, and operating the flight antenna from a mechanical perspective, its final performance, and lessons learned. KaPDA enabled the RainCube mission, the first Earth Science CubeSat to have an active instrument. RainCube was launched in May 2018, making KaPDA the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat and the first to operate in Ka-band, enabling follow-on opportunities for high-rate antenna communications and remote sensing science. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","309-322","","1","63","","AIAA J","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: AIAA International","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.F.

At first, the upper bound of electrically small patch is theoretically laid down by advancing an interpolated algorithm to the eigen-roots of the characteristic equation, so that the radius of patch can be rapidly determined in the initial design step. In this way, MASPA with electrically small patch, multimode resonant, and frequency scannable CP angle can be yielded. Dual-mode resonant MASPAs with flare angles of 330° on air substrate, and 270° on suspended microstrip air/F4B substrates having a profile less than 0.05-wavelength are then numerically studied and experimentally validated. In the suspended microstrip case, MASPA with maximum patch radius of 0.159-wavelength (electrically small), equal impedance and tilted CP bandwidths up to 26.6%, and tilted CP angle of θ<inf>t</inf> = −10°–35°, has been successfully implemented.

The proposed antenna is based on a planar rectangular patch configuration, featuring a microstrip planar patch attached to a coaxial SMA connector, and a second layer with a resonator and cavity model patch. The design methodology involves detailed calculations of the patch dimensions, effective permittivity, and matching impedance for a coaxial input of 50 Ohms. The truncated method is employed to achieve circular polarization, creating two orthogonal modes with a 90-degree phase difference by truncating the patch corners at 45 degrees. Parametric studies assess the impact of ground width, the gap between the resonator ring and main patch, and the gap between the top and bottom layers on the antenna's reflection coefficient (S11). The results indicate that a ground width of 46 mm and a 20 mm gap between the layers provide optimal impedance matching. The antenna's design is validated through simulation and practical implementation, demonstrating its effectiveness for CubeSat communication systems by achieving enhanced efficiency, reduced reflection, and improved overall performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","133-137","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

The antenna features a circular dielectric resonator sitting above a FR4 epoxy substrate, as well as a circular ground plane aperture. With a radiation gain of 7.51 dB and a return loss (S11) of-44.2976 dB, it has a centralized origin at the resonating frequency of 15.38 GHz. Over 2.72 GHz of impedance bandwidth is reported, which is incredibly wide. A comparison of this antenna's performance with that of the Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) without Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) ground structure has been made.The suggested design has better features than a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) without a Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR). We also have a great improvement in S11, which indicates perfect impedance matching, but a minor drop in Gain.

Metamaterials can be incorporated into the design either as a reflective surface placed at a precise distance from the antenna or by etching unit cells onto the patch or ground plane. Given the constraints of nanosatellite applications, maintaining a gap between the metamaterial and the antenna was deemed impractical, as space debris could accumulate, potentially altering performance or causing damage. To mitigate this risk, the metamaterial unit cell was etched into the ground plane, eliminating the need for separation support and reducing the antenna's overall volume. Both a conventional patch antenna and a metamaterial-based patch antenna with similar performance were designed and modeled to evaluate the benefits of metamaterial integration. The metamaterial antenna achieved a 21% size reduction. Right-hand circular polarization was obtained by truncating two diagonal corners of the patch. A prototype was fabricated and tested in the laboratory, revealing a resonance frequency shift to 2.458 GHz with a return loss of -35.2 dB and an increased bandwidth of 71 MHz.

The proposed antenna incorporates Radio Frequency Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (RF-MEMS) switches to selectively activate different iterations of the Minkowski fractal, thereby enabling dynamic tuning of the operating frequency bands. This reconfiguration mechanism allows for effective miniaturization, particularly at lower frequencies, without altering the overall physical dimensions of the antenna. Each additional fractal iteration results in a shift of the resonance towards lower frequencies, a behavior that is exploited to maintain compactness while achieving dual-band functionality. The antenna has been specifically optimized to operate in the 1 GHz and 4 GHz frequency bands, and its performance has been validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations using a commercial software tool. The resulting design is characterized by a compact footprint, structural simplicity, and low manufacturing cost, making it an excellent candidate for space-constrained platforms such as small satellites and CubeSats. Furthermore, the integration of RF-MEMS technology offers high precision in switching and improved reliability compared to traditional tuning elements, further enhancing the antenna’s applicability in modern reconfigurable communication systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","","","","Microsyst Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: I.

Traditionally applied in larger satellites, GPS-based relative navigation has been optimized for low-Earth orbit (LEO), where minimal signal interference allows precise navigation without additional sensors. However, previous systems faced limitations in real-time resolution of integer ambiguities inherent in GPS carrier-phase measurements, particularly in response to the rapidly changing satellite constellations in LEO. To overcome these issues, this paper adapts a conventional single-station RTK system for use in LEO. An efficient real-time Recursive Ambiguity Filter (RAF) is proposed to reduce the ambiguity search space, replacing the extended Kalman filter. Optimized for CubeSats with constrained computational resources, the algorithm was validated through ground-based tests using commercial GPS receivers and patch antennas. The proposed system performs real-time integer ambiguity resolution, achieving cm-level navigation accuracy and ensuring a 100% success-fix rate. Furthermore, it resolves integer ambiguities within 1 s using the CubeSat's on-board computer (OBC), marking a significant advancement in CubeSat navigation technology by enabling precise satellite positioning for rendezvous missions without requiring additional expensive hardware. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Aerosp.

This is particularly relevant for communication at 28 GHz, a key frequency in the mmWave spectrum, used for high-bandwidth satellite links and 5G communications. Critical design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, and Side Lobe Level (SLL) for each beam. However, in multibeam scenarios, balancing these design factors can result in uneven power distribution, leading to over-saturation in centrally located antenna elements due to frequent activations. This paper introduces a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to optimize beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix, while imposing a constraint on activation instances per element to avoid over-saturation in the Radio Frequency (RF) chain. The proposed method, tested on an 16×16 DRA patch antenna array at 28 GHz for a CubeSat orbiting at 500 km, demonstrates how the algorithm efficiently meets beam pattern requirements and ensures uniform activation distribution.

The antenna employs a truncated microstrip patch design combined with additional parasitic patches to achieve circular polarization. It is printed on an RT/duroid® 5880 substrate with a thickness of 0.6 mm and a relative permittivity of 2.2. The design consists of a central truncated radiating patch and four segment-circular parasitic patches, positioned near the edges of the substrate to enhance bandwidth and axial ratio performance, which is crucial for achieving circular polarization. The antenna is excited using a coaxial probe feed to ensure efficient energy transfer and proper impedance matching. Simulation results demonstrate that the antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth covering 1.80 GHz to 2.40 GHz with a reflection coefficient (|S11|) below -10 dB. The axial ratio remains below 3 dB across the frequency range of 2.025 GHz to 2.290 GHz, confirming circular polarization, with a minimum axial ratio of 1.34 dB at 2.25 GHz. Additionally, the antenna exhibits a stable gain of approximately 7.28 dBic at 2.15 GHz, making it suitable for CubeSat communication systems requiring reliable and efficient signal transmission. To further strengthen the contribution of this research, a performance comparison with existing CubeSat antennas is provided, along with a discussion of potential environmental impacts in space, such as temperature variations and radiation effects. Future work will focus on prototyping, experimental validation, and optimizing the antenna design for different mission scenarios, including scaling for other frequency bands and multi-antenna configurations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - iEECON : Int.

The antenna resonated at 2.43 GHz and exhibited an impedance bandwidth of 6.2% and a peak gain of 6.5 dBi. In the second design, a polymer layer replaced the upper glass substrate and was partially removed to reduce the antenna mass. 65% mass reduction was achieved at the expense of lower efficiency.

Moreover, by co-design and including air vias (AVs) for the surface-wave aperture, the structure becomes semi-transparent and can be positioned on top of solar panels, and this can improve solar power harvesting capabilities. Structure excitation is made possible by a leaky T-junction dual-feeder using substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, creating a uniform wavefront that propagates through a truncated parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) section. In addition, a matching section based on an array of subwavelength printed patches is also included at the interface between the PPW and the grounded dielectric slab (GDS), while the AV section is positioned between the GDS and air region to improve antenna radiation. These features allow for an efficient and compact aperture, and findings are competitive compared to other relevant structures. For instance, the measured prototype demonstrated a peak realized gain (RG) of 17.5 dBi at 18.6 GHz, as well as high radiation efficiency and sidelobe levels (SSLs) of about −10 dB.

CubeSats necessitate a high-gain antenna that can fit within a tightly confined space. This paper is primarily concerned with designing a compact Ku-band offset cylindrical reflector antenna for a CubeSat-based Earth Observation mission, with the goal of monitoring Arctic snow and sea ice. The development of a Ku-band offset cylindrical reflector, with a compact aperture of 110 × 149 mm2 (6.3λ × 8.5λ), is described alongside a patch array feed consisting of 2 × 8 elements. The patch array feed is designed using a lightweight Rogers substrate and is utilized to test the reflector. Adopting an offset configuration helped prevent gain loss due to feed blockage. Analyzing the reflector antenna, including the feed, thorough simulations and measurements indicates that achieving a gain of 25 dBi and an aperture efficiency of 52% at 17.2 GHz is attainable. The reflector’s cylindrical shape and compact size facilitate the design of a simple mechanism for reflector deployment, enabling the antenna to be stored within 1U. The array feed and reflector antenna have been fabricated and tested, demonstrating good consistency between the simulation and measurement outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","23","24","","Sensors","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: D.

Precise relative variations of sTEC are achievable using phase measurements on L1 and L2 frequencies, yielding an accuracy of around 0.1 TECU or better. However, CubeSats like Spire LEMUR, with simpler setups (e.g., patch antennas) and code noise in the order of several meters, face limitations in accuracy. Their precision, determined by phase observations, remains in the 0.1–0.3 TECU range. With a substantial number of observations and comprehensive coverage of lines of sight between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and GNSS satellites, global electron density can be reconstructed from sTEC measurements. Utilizing 27 satellites from various missions, including Swarm, Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On, Jason-3, Sentinel 1/2/3, COSMIC-2, and Spire CubeSats, a cubic B-spline expansion in magnetic latitude, magnetic local time, and altitude is employed to model the logarithmic electron density. Hourly snapshots of the three-dimensional electron density are generated, adjusting the model parameters through non-linear least squares based on sTEC observations. Results demonstrate that including Spire significantly enhances estimates, showcasing exceptional agreement with in situ observations from Swarm and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program LEO satellites. The model outperforms contemporary climatological models, such as International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)-2020 and the neural network-based NET model. Validation efforts include comparisons with ground-based sTEC measurements, space-based vertical TEC from Jason-3 altimetry, and global TEC maps from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe and the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:12","2025-11-07 22:06:12","","","","12","59","","Radio Sci","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: L.

The presented method was created with student-led teams in mind and employs a geometrically simple approach, opting for circular patches and ring-shaped feed networks instead of complex geometries. High- and low-impedance radiating elements are designed, and design restrictions are introduced such that all other geometries may be solved through a set of simple cascading equations. These deliberate choices minimize the number of design parameters and simplify the design process. Circular polarization is achieved through a multilevel implementation of sequentially arranged linearly polarized circular patches fed in a series-parallel fashion by ring-shaped feed lines of constant impedance. This article also demonstrates a 4× 4 right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) CubeSat downlink array antenna designed for operation in the 8025-8400-MHz Earth exploration satellite band which was developed using the proposed methodology. The antenna comprises four sequentially rotated RHCP subarrays, each consisting of four sequentially rotated linearly polarized circular patches. The antenna's boresight RHCP gain exceeds 16.19 dBic at 8.389 GHz with a simulated 27.9% 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth, a 20° half-power beamwidth, and an aperture efficiency of 53%. The antenna has a sub-2 VSWR bandwidth of 26.6%, and its radiation efficiency ranges from 60% to 82% across the target band.

Particularly, small satellite missions for deep space exploration offer accessible and low-cost solutions to realize in-orbit testing and to settle new international collaborations for research activities. Thanks to their flexibility, fast implementation and increasing reliability, small satellites can be employed to conduct scientific exploration missions on outer planets and celestial bodies in the solar system, such as the Moon surface's observations and its craters studies. In this framework, a student team from S5Lab (Sapienza Space System and Space Surveillance Laboratory), at Sapienza University of Rome, developed the MOTHS mission (Moon Observation Through Hyperspectral Satellites). MOTHS is a 6U CubeSat Moon constellation, deployed on two orbital planes, and designed entirely using COTS components. The mission was developed with the primary objective of studying and analyzing Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLP). The importance of the mission lies in the necessity of conducting an in-depth study of the TLPs, which have thus far only been detected and analysed through observation perfonned from Earth. These phenomena are strongly related to various events happening in the Moon environment such as Argon, Radon and Polonium outgassing, making crucial their understanding for future lunar landing sites and lunar settlements establishment. The TLPs are phenomena that appear on the surface of the moon and consist of short-lived changes in light, colour and appearance on the surface of the moon, which can range from foggy patches to pennanent changes in the lunar landscape. To study the TLP and all the related effects, the MOTHS primary payload consists of a hyperspectral camera equipped with a CMOS sensor payload, which enables the detection of the TLPs and of the outgassing phenomena, specifically targeting gases such as Argon, Radon, and Polonium. Moreover, to support in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU), such as rover and lander, MOTHS is equipped with a GNSS receiver together with its integrated patch antenna as a secondary payload. This payload will enable the exploitation of the MOTHS constellation as a relay system for future lunar navigation satellite systems (LNSS). In this paper, after the description of the mission concept and the mission analysis, the satellite design will be analysed, focusing on the hyperspectral payload and the GNSS system. Furthermore, it explores the possibility of synergic collaborations with future lunar human exploration activities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","1767-1772","","","3-C","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This advancement, framed within the BIXO mission by the student team of UVigo SpaceLab at the University of Vigo, addresses the need for an advanced communication system for the efficient transmission of images, particularly in projects that house payloads such as cameras utilising software-defined radios in S-band. The educational significance of this project lies in the opportunity it offers students to engage in technological design and development processes, applying their theoretical knowledge in a practical context and gaining experience in the field of space engineering. This training focuses primarily on the design of the antenna and the planning and execution of the necessary tests to validate the antenna. The testing methodology adopted for the patch antenna was meticulously designed to ensure its optimal performance under specific operational conditions in space. This antenna testing model planned various tests in an anechoic chamber to evaluate the radiation pattern and the impedance of the antenna, ensuring its compatibility with the requirements of the BIXO mission. The antenna design was carried out using advanced electromagnetic simulation software, which allowed for the optimisation of its shape and dimensions to maximise performance in the S-band. Factors such as weight, size, and resistance to the space environment were considered to develop an antenna that not only met the technical specifications but also adapted to the physical limitations of CubeSats. This comprehensive approach, covering the design phase, reflects the technical depth of the project and its contribution to the advancement of satellite communications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","358-367","","","","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Despite the ongoing standardization efforts within the space community, the unique payload requirements of the AcubeSAT mission, an open-source nanosatellite that aims to probe the effects of radiation and microgravity on eukaryotic cells in Low Earth orbit (LEO) within the FYS3 program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office, necessitated the development of a custom, cost-effective module. This module shall not only meet the spatial and functional demands of the mission but also serve as an educational tool, providing valuable hands-on experience to project members involved in designing space-grade equipment and developing critical system software that follow the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) Standard. The single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) hosts two distinct subsystems: one resembling a conventional OBC responsible for telecommand execution, telemetry fetching, onboard time synchronization, in-orbit patching, and Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR). The second entails the implementation of an Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) for both nominal and downlinking scenarios, facilitating a directional patch antenna for payload data transmission. The hardware for each subsystem resides on separate sides of the PCB and includes non-volatile memories for critical data and telemetry storage, custom radiation-tested Latch-up Current Limiter (LCL) protection circuits, sensors, interfaces with the Payload Subsystem, the actuators and the rest of the in-house and Commercial of the Shell (COTS) components, all while maintaining compatibility with the LibreCube standard. At the core of each subsystem lies a Radiation Tolerant Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) Cortex-M7 MCU. This architecture not only decentralizes processing power, mitigating single points of failure but also leverages redundancy capabilities. This paper aims to elucidate the decision-making process, design iterations, and development stages of the custom board and accompanying in-house software. Insights garnered from the initial partially successful environmental test campaign at the ESA CubeSat Support Facility (CSF) will be shared, along with the ensuing preparations, results, and lessons learned from subsequent testing endeavors in April 2024. Furthermore, the current developmental status will be discussed alongside future Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing, integration plan on a FlatSat, and prospects for the open-source design as a cost-effective, and modular solution that can be tailored with little effort for upcoming missions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","321-331","","","","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The antenna operating at either band shares similar geometries, consisting of four small square patches fed by two orthogonally deployed inverted-F shaped antennas (IFAs) and an L-shaped metal strip to enhance inter-port isolation. By optimizing the geometrical sizes, two types of antenna elements are adjusted to operate in the K- and Ka-band, respectively.

Deployable antennas offer a solution to achieve large antenna apertures, while allowing to stow the aperture during the launch process. This paper presents a novel deployment mechanism based on embedded dielectric thread, and studies the effects of this thread in the performance of the metasurface elements of the deployable antenna. The proposed hinge mechanism minimizes gaps created by traditional hinges, ensuring structural integrity and RF performance. Direct light processing is used to manufacture the channelized metasurface elements which are metalized using silver conductive pastes. Experimental results show that the channelized structure introduces minimal phase variation of 1.15% (1.92°) and 0.139 dB of added loss at 30 GHz, making it suitable for use with deployable reflectarrays in space applications.

While beneficial, the limitations to weight and form inhibit the capabilities of a CubeSat's antenna. As such, CubeSats are commonly used in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), as they are limited by antenna transmission strength and available power. Although within recent years, progress has been made into deep-space CubeSat applications. The reflectarray (RA) antenna is a compact, high-gain antenna (HGA), which is compatible with CubeSat and capable of transmission from Deep-Space. This paper explores the design and manufacture of a reflectarray and it's unit cell (UC), using consumer-grade FR-4 substrate to lower the barrier of entry to Deep-Space research. This demonstrates a frequency tolerant unit-cell with 308° range of reflection and 1.44dB resonance loss. The resulting RA provides 28.66dB gain to a linearly polarised signal, when operating at 9.5GHz. The printed antenna weighs 702g gross mass.

The goal of this research project is to create a compact and ultra-wideband planar antenna array for satellite images remote sensing, utilizing future CubeSat-swarm communication. It should be noted that the characteristics of planar antenna arrays at higher frequencies enable the creation of small-size, low-volume antenna arrays that can improve the quality and data rates of communication links between large numbers of swarm parts. These advantages are crucial for the next generation of tiny and ultra-small spacecraft missions, which will use the tiniest configurations—CubeSats, FemtoSats, and ZeptoSats—for both commercial and educational uses. The obtained findings demonstrate that this tiny antenna array radiates with an impedance bandwidth of about 5.50 GHz along practically the entire K-band. Additionally, it provides a strong gain of around 6.5 dBi with a very low chance of interfering with other circuits within the spaceship body. The constructed antenna array also exhibits cheap cost, low weight, low volume, good impedance matching in the Ka-band, and a return loss of around 37 dB. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","923-934","","","1195 LNEE","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The radiometer is designed to be deployed in a CubeSat for Earth observation and weather monitoring. Its working principle relies on the nonlinearity of lithium niobate, which enables an upconversion process that boosts the microwave photon energy to the optical domain, where photodetectors are less susceptible to thermal noise at room temperature than their microwave counterparts. The key parts of the radiometer are the upconverter, which consists of an optical subsystem formed by a lithium niobate ring resonator and an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI), and an RF subsystem, which consists of two half-wavelength resonators and two patch antennas. To test the response of the former subsystem, a ring resonator and an AMZI were initially integrated into a lithium niobate photonic integrated circuit (PIC). This paper presents the experimental characterization of the optical components as well as the design and working principles of the upconverter. Regarding the optical components, we measured intrinsic quality factors of around 0.65 · 106 in the ring resonator and extinction ratios of about 20 dB in the AMZI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

It decides to use a low-profile, all-metal patch antenna array combined with the aluminum box of a 1.5U CubeSat to obtain a very high stiffness configuration for advanced space communication. As a result, the purpose of this research is to develop a unique metallic antenna array arrangement that is welded to the body of the 1.5U CubeSat and designed to deliver a low-cost, low-power, suitable, and high-performance AeroCube antenna system. The constructed antenna array is built of copper and tuned using the Quasi Newtonian Method to give a wide HPBW with a peak gain of around 12.5 dBi at Ka-band. Furthermore, it has a significant return loss and is circularly polarized, although taking up less than half of the 1.5U CubeSat's large face. The suggested metallic antenna array is lightweight and inexpensive, with a particularly stiff construction suitable for usage in space. As a consequence of these successes, advanced AeroCube missions may now be targeted using 1.5U CubeSat designs for very high-resolution CubeSat communication at a low cost and power consumption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

As a result, metasurface antennas, due to their subwavelength profile, have started to attract interest from space agencies and industry as an alternative to reflector-based antennas. Compared to reflector-based antennas, metasurface antennas lend themselves to low-cost fabrication technologies, including PCB technology and additive manufacturing, etc. Furthermore, the subwavelength texturing of metasurfaces provides additional degrees of freedom, allowing for extreme beamforming, polarization control, and multiband operation. In this abstract, an all-metal dual-beam metasurface antenna for small platform space Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems is proposed. The antenna's main beams overlap within their 3dB beamwidth, increasing the SAR system resolution without compromising its swath coverage. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the antenna consists of a waveguide-fed metasurface-based beamformer that excites an array of resonant slotted waveguides. In addition to beamforming, the metasurface isolates the input feeds. The metasurface-based beamformer consists of a multi-layer metasurface placed inside an over-moded waveguide, connected to the input feeds at one end and the slotted waveguides at the other. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","421","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INC-USNC-URSI Radio Sci.

Consequently, flat-panel phased array antennas have also gained popularity as the most suitable hardware options, owing to their low profile, rapid electronic beam steering and high reliability. Microstrip patch antennas are commonly chosen for these flat-panel arrays for their compactness and low cost; however, it is important to note that these antennas are often characterized by narrow bandwidths. As a remedy, stacked configuration of patch antennas – that enables larger impedance bandwidths – can be used. This work aims to design a wideband dual-circularly polarized flat-panel phased array antenna that can operate at both the Ku-band downlink (10.7–12.75 GHz) and uplink (14–14.5 GHz) satellite communication (SATCOM) bands simultaneously. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","333","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INC-USNC-URSI Radio Sci.

Dipole antennas necessitate deployable subsystems for 2U CubeSats, which have a limited space margin for redundant components inside the box, making the antenna deployment subsystem a single point of failure. In this letter, a 50 Ω coplanar waveguide strip line supplied the integrated metallic antenna array. The goal of this research is to create a high-strength 2U CubeSat body integrated metallic patch antenna capable of performing for infinite lifespan CubeSat flights while using little power. Due to the Quasi Newtonian Method’s optimization of the entire antenna architecture, the antenna has a high return loss, a peak gain of almost 17.0 dBi, and an incredibly broad impedance bandwidth centered on the working frequency of 12.05 GHz. In addition, the proposed metallic antenna array is cheap, lightweight, and has a very stiff construction for usage in space applications. These achievements enable us to continue pursuing long-term, low-cost, high-altitude satellite missions using 2U CubeSat designs at low power consumption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","45-54","","","991 LNNS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

This integration is foreseen to be exploited in space by small satellites to enable wireless power transfer among them, while maintaining optimal solar power production, with no need for extra areas for the antenna subsystems. The proposed antenna arrays utilize a novel approach, where horizontal conductive strips of a meshed metallization are removed, to enhance transparency without compromising antenna performance. Two arrays are designed at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz, and the associated design choices and issues are discussed. The antenna metallizations make use of vertical strips only with a line spacing of 0.04\boldsymbol {\lambda } , found to be the best compromise to ensure maximal transparency and antenna performance, using low-cost printing technique on 110 mm \times 110 mm borosilicate glass. Simulations and experiments show that the underlying PV metallization patterns have a significant impact on the antenna radiation properties at the highest operating frequency of 5.8 GHz. In this case, a degradation of the antenna gain compared to the predictions is observed. Through a reverse-engineering method, this effect is modeled by the effective electromagnetic characteristics of the glass substrate, rather than by accounting for the pattern layout-wise. It is demonstrated that this choice enables an efficient yet accurate full-wave simulation of the entire system, suggesting the necessity for a co-design of the PV panel and the antenna to facilitate an accurate representation of the entire system and its current radiating characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:13","2025-11-07 22:06:13","","516-525","","","8","","IEEE J.

Constellations of small satellites offer worldwide coverage of wireless communication and earth observation; high-gain antennas are required to realize high-speed communication and high-resolution radar. This paper aims to develop a CubeSat onboard high-gain reflectarray antenna that can be folded compactly and deployed in space. The novelty of this paper is the stretchable-substrate-impregnated fabric, which can realize low stowage volume with high fabrication tolerance and low resistivity with single-piece reflectarray to avoid gain degradation. The origami-folding-pattern compatible reflection elements can avoid creases on the elements, avoiding gain reduction after folding.

The folded volume of the reflectarray is 27 mm in height and 58 mm in diameter, and the measured fabrication tolerance of the reflection element was 20 ~μ m at most. Electrical antenna measurements confirmed low resistivity of 1.20 mΩ /Box and a high realized gain of 23.6 dBi, comparable with conventional flexible printed circuit reflectarray antennas.

To adapt the algorithm to the CubeSat platform and apply centimeter-level relative navigation using only single-frequency measurements commonly available in GPS receivers for CubeSat, various performance degradation issues arise due to constraints imposed by the onboard systems, such as limited power, computing resources, and redundancy assurance. Therefore, when applying GPS-based precise relative navigation to CubeSat missions for autonomous formation flying and rendezvous docking, it is essential to consider the performance impact resulting from the hardware characteristics of the onboard computer, space GPS receiver, and GPS antenna. The relative navigation algorithm used in this application is developed based on a software GPS simulator in a LEO environment. Before validating the algorithm for satellite deployment, ground validation must be prioritized. In other words, understanding the differences between the LEO and ground environments and establishing a sequential verification procedure for the relative navigation algorithm are required. For this purpose, we aim to validate the developed precision relative navigation algorithm for CubeSats incrementally using measurements collected on the ground and analyze the actual hardware characteristics to achieve algorithm verification goal. To validate the utility of the proposed technique, we first verify the effectiveness of the developed CubeSat RTK relative navigation algorithm. Here, the algorithm's validation and performance are analyzed by utilizing actual measurements with reliable high-cost GPS receivers and antennas. Subsequently, hardware characteristics and performance analysis are conducted by sequentially applying GPS patch antennas and space GPS receivers installed on the CubeSat. Through the proposed technique, we demonstrate that SNUGLITE-III CubeSat relative navigation system can provide centimeter-level performance, even when considering the hardware characteristics of the CubeSat platform. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","787-798","","","2024-January","","","","","","","","Institute of Navigation","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Key design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), and Side Lobe Level (SLL) for each beam. However, a challenge arises in multibeam scenarios when trying to simultaneously meet requirements for the aforementioned design factors which are reflected as uneven power distribution. This leads to over-saturation, especially in centrally located antenna elements due to the activation times per beam, commonly referred to as activation instances. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a method to balance the activation instances across antenna elements for each required beam. Our focus is on beams operating at 19 GHz on a CubeSat positioned 500 km above the Earth's surface. We introduce a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based algorithm to optimize the beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix for each antenna element. A key constraint of this algorithm is a limit on activation instances per element, which avoids over-saturation in the Radio Frequency (RF) chain. Additionally, the algorithm accommodates beam requirements such as beamwidth, SLL, pointing direction, and total available power. With the previous key design factors, the algorithm will optimize the required genes to address the desired beam characteristics and constraints. We tested the algorithm's effectiveness in three scenarios using an 8times 8 DRA patch antenna with circular polarization, arranged in a triangular lattice. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only meets the required beam pattern specifications but also ensures a uniform activation distribution across the antenna array. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","2343-2357","","","5","","IEEE open J.

Shared aperture antennas, along with an air gap and dielectric loading, provided good gain in both frequency bands. The S-band patch had an S<inf>11</inf> = −10 dB bandwidth of 30 MHz (2013–2043 MHz, 1.5%), and the X-band antenna demonstrated a bandwidth of 210 MHz (8320–8530 MHz, 2.5%).

Applications include small satellites like CubeSats and picosatellites. The proposed 2 × 2 FSP array design operates at 1.1 and 2.4 GHz and offers good radiation performance in terms of minimal reflection coefficient losses, broad beamwidths (which is generally required for low gain antenna structures ensuring link connectivity), as well as low cross-polarization levels. The antenna array consists of a meandered layer defining the top of the FSPs. The shorting and folding technique as well as the noted meandering allows further size reduction of the quarter-wavelength patch. In particular, the proposed antenna array is compact with a total size of 50 mm by 50 mm (or 0.18λ by 0.18λ at the lower operational frequency). An eight-port coaxial and microstrip feed system is integrated onto the backside of the antenna ground plane, two ports for each element, and with external phase feeding of 90°, dual-circularly polarized is made possible for the compact antenna unit. To the best knowledge of the authors, no similar antenna structure has been designed, manufactured and tested being useful for picosatellites and other small satellites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","","","21","59","","Electron.

First, a dataset of 715 full-wave simulated samples is analyzed with four distinct antenna characteristics (viz. features), along with the related computed (Formula presented.), gain, and AR. Using mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R (Formula presented.) score, 12 ML regression models were examined to compare the training data with the new predicted values. Next, the model that best satisfies our objectives was chosen. Results showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) followed by k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regression produced the lowest error compared to all tested ML models.

The packaging ability of origami antennas is of great interest for CubeSat applications in particular. However, traditional origami is based on the manipulation of thin sheets, making physical reconfigurability with thick substrates very difficult. In this article, we present a foldable series-fed patch array designed on a strictly rigid printed circuit board (PCB). Notably, the array does not require any external mechanical folding appendages (i.e., brackets, tapes, or offsets), and it can be manufactured using commercially available PCBs and equipment. The PCB itself is strategically cut to form lamina emergent torsion (LET) joints. When fully deployed, the array operates at 5.7 GHz. A significant shift is not seen in the operational frequency until the folding exceeds 60° (5.7-5.61 GHz). This shows that the array, even in a state of near extreme faulty deployment, will operate as intended. An 8 × 6 prototype array was fabricated using a Rogers DiClad 880. When fully deployed, the array is extended in a surface area of 280 × 198 × 1.524 mm and can be folded into a 35.5 × 198 × 12.5-mm compartment. The array held its integrity well after 100 cycles. (One cycle starts at a state of full deployment, moves to a state of being fully packaged, and goes back to a state of full deployment.) Measurements show that the active reflection coefficients are in good agreement with the finite array simulations. The measured realized gains at 5.7 GHz for 0° and 30° folds were 22.4 and 21.4 dBi, respectively. At the 60° fold, a realized gain of 20.6 dBi was achieved at the frequency of 5.61 GHz. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","77-82","","3","65","","IEEE Antennas Propag Mag","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 12; CODEN: IAPME</p>","","","Antenna arrays; Antenna feeders; Antennas measurement; Cubesat; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric power transmission; Foldings; Gain; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Patch arrays; Power divider; Printed circuit boards; Prototype; Reconfigurability; Series feed; Slot antennas; Transmission-line measurements; Voltage dividers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A CP stacked microstrip patch antenna is used as the element radiator with a structural modification on the parasitic patch to minimize gain variation. Since the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the element radiator is inherently narrow, sequential rotation is employed to yield a wide AR bandwidth while forming the $2\times 2$ subarray, which is then used as a building block to construct the larger $8\times 8$ phased array. The phased array has a simulated scan range of ±51°, $\boldsymbol {\pm }46^{\circ }$ , and $\boldsymbol {\pm }36^{\circ }$ at 23, 24, and 26.5 GHz, respectively, assuming $\boldsymbol {\le }3$ dB scan loss and AR. A beamforming network (BFN) is integrated within the stackup of the phased array that comprises a commercially available silicon beamforming chip. This facilitates beam steering through the independent control of the input amplitudes and phases of the individual element radiators. The practical effects of the BFN on the scanning performance of the $8\times 8$ phased array are studied, which is found to slightly degrade the scan ranges. Finally, experiments were performed on the fabricated prototype, and the measured scan data showed good correspondence with their simulated counterparts with $\mathbf {>}41^{\circ }$ and 35° scan ranges (in $\mathbf {+\theta }$ -direction) at 24 and 26.5 GHz, respectively.

It is developed by SpaceDot, a volunteer, interdisciplinary student team at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and supported by the”Fly Your Satellite! 3” program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office. The scientific data of the mission is comprised of microscope images captured through the on-board integrated camera setup. As the total size of the payload data is expected to be close to 2GB over 12 months, a fast and efficient downlink fulfilling the restrictive power, cost and complexity budgets is required. Currently, there is no open-source communications system design which fully supports these specific constraints, so we opted to develop our own solutions. The antenna system underwent multiple iterations as the design matured, a process highly aided by the feedback received from the European Space Agency (ESA) experts. The final communications system configuration consists of an S-band microstrip antenna operating at 2.4GHz and a Ultra High Frequency (UHF) deployable antenna, for the payload data and Telemetry & Telecommand (TM&TC) respectively, both in-house designed. In this paper, we will present AcubeSAT's antenna system iterations that span over 3 years, as well as the rationale and analysis results behind each.

The space assets foreseen to be launched in 2024/25 will be injected into a 550 km equatorial orbit. They embark a miniaturized spectrometer to continuously monitor the celestial sphere to localize Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and promptly report their occurrence and spherical coordinated (R.A. and declination) on Earth to scientists. A maximum of a 30 min time span from the random events occurrence to its data download is imposed; therefore, the Iridium Constellation has been selected as a continuously in-sight network for GRB occurrence data transfer, and satellites have been equipped with the due modem and antenna. No matter of GRBs occurrence, a 1 Gb/day scientific data volume is expected, therefore an S-band link is also part of the telecommunication architecture for the mission. It is also exploited for the service module space-to-ground data exchange, in nominal phases. HERMES is also equipped with a deployable omnidirectional antenna to support LEOP and contingency phases with the UHF/VHF bands. All that reflects in two patches antenna for the S-Band and transceivers for S and low-frequency bands respectively (SkyLabs products). The ground segment leans on two mission-devoted ground stations at Malindi (Kenya) and Katherine (Australia), both using a 3-meter dish and a UHF/VHF Yagi antennae system. The paper goes through the incremental approach adopted to test the whole telecom architecture for flight. First, the Iridium EM modem is operated through AT commands using serial communication, while the EM transceivers are tested with the provider's testing software. Then, the focus moved to each board interface with the main on-board computer (OBC) verification and testing, through the framework of Flight Software Development Kit (FSDK-Bright Ascension) HERMES adopts, which emulates the flight SW to run on the OBC. A Universal Software Radio Peripheral is used to assess the quality of the antennae communication, comparing a cabled with the antennae transmission. A further verification occurred on the space2ground link, exploiting the S-band C3S ground station in Hungary to validate the packets content simulating losses. Currently, the telecom boards, connected to the OBC, are undergoing testing for some basic routines without manual control. The next step sees the whole telecom test plan to run on the HERMES FlatSat before assembly and integration. Lessons learnt, issues and solutions along the adopted test plan will be discussed in depth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","","","","2023-October","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Therefore, a deployable volume-efficient Miura-ori (VEMO) reflectarray aperture is presented that achieves high gain (35.3-dBi) and high volume efficiency (96%). The design is based on a modified Miura-Ori origami folding pattern that allows for ultra-high volume efficiency and simple deployment. In its stowed state, the aperture fits in a cuboid volume (8.0-cm ×8.0 -cm ×2.5 -cm) that occupies just 16% of the volume of a 1U CubeSat. The aperture is deployed by releasing stored energy from strategically placed neodymium magnets in the magnetic longitudinal offset (MaLO) hinge system. The aperture has a large reflecting surface area (24.8-cm ×24.8 -cm) that is stabilized by the MaLO hinges. The antenna operates in the Ka-band (38-GHz), and provides low side lobe level (-17.5-dB), high cross-polarization discrimination (37.1-dB), and acceptable efficiency (27.4%). The main advantage of the proposed VEMO RA antenna is that it achieves high gain with a design that is straightforward, low-cost, and easily deployable while occupying only a small portion of the payload volume.

This research work presents an initial attempt to utilize these fractal properties in the design of a patch antenna, adopting a geometry that allows it to be incorporated into a standard 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm (or 1U) CubeSat. Prior to fabrication, a preliminary design was analyzed and simulated using a commercial finite element method (FEM) solver for electromagnetic structures software, High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS)™. The proposed antenna was designed at a solution frequency, f= 920 MHz and resonates well from 800 MHz to 1 GHz. The antenna was fabricated on an FR4 substrate (Formula presented). Comparison of the simulated and measured results showed a good agreement in terms of reflection coefficient and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the proposed antenna at the frequency of interest. For comparison, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) antenna was also characterized and measured. The measured peak gain of the proposed fractal antenna is at 3.148 dBi as confirmed by the radiation pattern results. It also exhibits a reflection coefficient of −26.110 dB, a VSWR of 1.104, and a wide bandwidth (BW) across the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. This type of antenna has the potential to provide a reliable link between a CubeSat and a ground sensor terminal (GST) as confirmed by the long-range communication tests.

Our goals are to achieve 1) a gain of >6 dBi, 2) an axial ratio (AR) of <3 dB, and 3) a return loss of < -10 across a 10% bandwidth. To do so, we start with a data-set of 715 full-wave simulated samples with 4 different antenna parameters (viz. features) along with the corresponding computed S11, gain, and AR. Various ML regression models were analyzed to compare the training data with new predicted values using mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R2 score. Then, the best model that meets our goals was chosen. In our work, ten different regression models were analyzed. Among them, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) regression produced the lowest error. Using the outcome of this model, we predicted the design parameters that achieve our desired goals. The predicted design was verified using full-wave simulation, showing a great agreement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","1849-1850","","","2023-July","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Antennas Propag Soc AP S Int Symp","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC-URSI Radio Science Meeting, AP-S/URSI 2023; Conference location: Portland; OR; Oregon Convention Center and Hyatt Regency; Conference sponsors: IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S); The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); US National Committee (USNC) for the International Union of Radio Science (URSI); CODEN: IAPSB</p>","","","Axial ratio; Cubesat; Data set; Design approaches; Errors; Intelligent designs; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Mean square error; Micro-strip patch antennas; Microstrip antennas; Microstrip-patch antenna; Microwave antennas; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Regression modelling; Returns loss; Slot antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AP-S International Symposium (Digest) (IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Small satellites are transforming the space industry, allowing space access with an important cost reduction for satellite industries and a shorter plan development time compared to bulky satellites. Moreover, using additive manufacturing, it is possible to design specific system components, also with a complex geometry of the inner part, without material wasting. Furthermore, a key point of 3D printing is to allow to go from design to construction straight, having an enormous effect on the supply chain. Generally, CubeSats count on Very High Frequency and Ultra High Frequency communication systems for low bit-rate uplink and downlink. Instead, S-band is among the favourite choices for high bit rates since the frequency range 2.40-2.45 GHz is one of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) amateur satellite frequency range. An S-band printed antenna system is designed in the present paper, considering the limitations on size and the weight of CubeSat standard. The antenna system is simulated with an electromagnetic CAD, using the polylactic acid as substrate, or polylactide, a thermoplastic polyester widely used in 3D printing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:14","2025-11-07 22:06:14","","","","","2526","","","","","","","","Institute of Physics","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: J.

Due to physical limitations, current and future wireless technologies as well as the cutting-edge compact satellites need antenna systems that are dependable, effective, and have a large bandwidth. The fifth generation of mobile communication technology promises to deliver fast data rates, low latency, and exceptional spectrum efficiency. One of the most crucial factors that makes this technology possible is the way in which satellite technology is integrated with terrestrial communication systems. Therefore, it is crucially important to develop next-generation antennas that can meet the functional requirements for 5G and CubeSat applications. Additionally, the antenna components need to be small and low-profile for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) to function properly. Reconfigurable antennas can offer a wide range of configurations in terms of operating frequency, radiation pattern, and polarization. This paper aims to investigate pixel antenna arrays for wireless communication and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Design, analysis, and comparison have been done on both the traditional and proposed pixel design configurations. The proposed pixel patch design area reduction is about 75%, and the full design area reduction is about 90%, compared to conventional patches. The pixel design parameters of these antennas are carefully examined to increase their gain, radiation pattern, and efficiency. For a variety of applications, increased gain and various radiation pattern configurations may be advantageous. As a result, increasing the coverage of 5G, 6G, and small satellites requires antennas with a small size, higher gain, and better radiation patterns. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-07 22:06:15","2025-11-07 22:06:15","","209-225","","","131","","Prog.

To increase the bandwidth of the operation without enlarging antenna size, we have proposed a circular patch antenna, which is composed of two sectors with two different radii (or two different dimensions). The proposed configuration of the circular patch, including two sectors, allows for enhancing the bandwidth of the operation and yields a dual-band Microstrip antenna. Patch dimensions have been designed such that the ratio of two resonant frequencies becomes 0.9. This work has a major contribution of synthesizing a highly-directive broadside radiation pattern by the array geometry of 4 × 1.

As the missions and functionalities become more complex, coupled with the popular VHF and UHF bands becoming less accessible, CubeSats have been getting pushed into using higher frequency bands. For more capable CubeSats such as NASA and military satellites, utilization of S- and X-band communication have become a common place. While S- and X-band communication provide much higher data rate for the mission, the power and attitude control demand has also increased. Meeting this increased cost and demand on resources may not be feasible for university-level projects as attitude control systems can often cost more than the rest of the CubeSat. This research revisits passive magnetic pointing as an option for providing antenna pointing capability for CubeSats, enabling S- and X-band communication without requiring an active attitude control system. CubeSats can make contact with ground stations located at higher latitude to establish data link with directional antennas. The analyses shows that a higher data throughput can be achieved using S- and X-band communication over the traditional 9600 bps link with the proposed setup, without requiring active attitude control or deployable solar panels.

Therefore, a microstrip patch antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator cavity antenna share only single aperture. A shaped ground is used to decrease the resonance at the lower band. Then, the aperture of the antenna is only 0.3λ 0 ,× , 0.3λ 0 , which makes it easy to integrate with a 1U CubeSat. The measurement reveals that the antenna has a common bandwidth of ( | S 11 < -10 dB, AR < 3 dB) 1% and 1.4%, an isolation higher than 35 and 20 dB, a peak gain of 5.82 and 13.75 dBic at UHF and C-band, respectively. The frequency ratio of these two bands reaches 6.4. The above properties make the proposed antenna suitable for a CubeSat system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:15","2025-11-07 22:06:15","","3818-3823","","5","70","","IEEE Trans Antennas Propag","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 39; Correspondence Address: C.

This technology works in the unlicensed ISM band and covers all the globe with different frequencies, which can improve the wide and rapid spread of information. To obtain global IoT coverage using LoRa, the use of satellite networks is mandatory. The development of nanosatellites, mostly in the CubeSat form factor, for communication applications in general and LoRa communication in particular, is currently increasing. To date, these satellites usually use linear wire deployable antennas for communication. However, deployable mechanical systems present the risk of failure during the mission. In fact, one-unit CubeSat geometry allows a very small space (10 cm * 10 cm * 0.06 cm) for the antenna. Since the size of the antenna is proportional to wavelengths, the antenna size is a large problem for low frequencies, especially in the UHF band. For this reason, planar antennas are an attractive solution for CubeSat communications. This work presents the design of a miniaturized printed monopole meander line antenna working at a frequency of 920 MHz. The novelty of the design is obtained by placing the meander line and the ground plane onto similar sides of the antenna. The meander line allows reduction of the antenna size by a factor of λ/5 for the selected operating frequency. The structure of this proposed antenna has a low profile, and a small size of 50 * 80 * 1.635 mm3 or about 0.153λ<inf>0</inf> * 0.245 λ<inf>0</inf>. It has an S11 magnitude of –33.53 dB obtained by simulation and S11 magnitude of −19 dB obtained through experimental measurements.

For this purpose, a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receiver with two receive channels and a custom-built two-patch antenna are used. The SDR captures the RF signals and forwards the data to a special processing platform with a powerful SoC for data processing. During the environmental unit-level tests of the satellite's subsystems, the payload system consisting of the SDR and the processing platform was thermally characterised in a vacuum. During this characterisation, it was found that the system can be powered only for a short time due to the high power consumption causing high thermal heating. Various countermeasures were analysed and implemented to allow an operation time of more than 30 minutes, which is the intended duration of a passive reflectometry experiment. This paper presents the characterisation measurements, the findings, the implemented countermeasures and the finally implemented design improvements yielding a highly improved maximum operation time.

These satellites will likely communicate with each other via an inter-satellite link (ISL) to enable control and relative navigation signals, information processing and health data exchange for achieving mission objectives. Small satellite missions in low earth orbit (LEO) were based on similar larger satellites but with some limitations. These limitations are due to mass, power, size, deployment mechanism, coast, capacity and operational period. Varieties of antenna types and antenna architectures have been proposed for small satellites to withstand these constraints. So, it is important to design and implement an antenna system that has low profile and can sustain wireless links between two interlinked satellites. In this paper we develop C-band microstrip antenna array operating at 5.8 GHz based on an inset fed microstrip antenna as a single element. The proposed antenna array radiation characteristics were examined on CST simulation software. The simulation results show an efficient line-of-sight (LOS) array performance to enable real time communication and control operation through the inter-satellite link during mission life. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:15","2025-11-07 22:06:15","","","","","2022-September","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

A greater number of companies are basing their analyses on data sourced from CubeSat constellations, which in turn require an adequate level of navigation precision for data geotagging and for constellation housekeeping maneuvers, to maintain the required relative geometry. Miniaturization and the advancement of consumer electronics are also increasing performances of commercial components, with navigation Systems-on-a-Chip now able to receive and process data from most navigation constellations simultaneously, thus increasing the overall fixing precision. GAUSS has been developing, manufacturing, and launching micro-satellites since 2000. One of the company's objectives is the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, instead of space-grade elements, to lower mission costs, as well as gaining valuable insights on the space effectiveness of such items. GAUSS' latest satellite, launched on March 22nd, 2021, included several original subsystems developed specifically for this and future missions. A GPS navigation subsystem based on a low-cost, COTS element was designed and employed in UNISAT-7 mission. It was conceived using lean-satellite philosophy, with a swift development, assembly, and testing phase. The first prototype's 3D fix in LEO orbital conditions was accomplished in GAUSS' RF laboratory, using a multi-satellite GPS signal simulator developed using software-defined-radios and open-source software. An increment in reliability of the flight subsystem was assured by a selective, manual revision and strengthening of critical elements on the electronic board, to mechanically secure key components and guarantee an endurance level suitable for space conditions. The system was then verified in TVAC and during environmental test sessions at flight qualification levels. The GNSS receiver was coupled with a COTS L1 active microstrip antenna, typically employed on civilian aviation leisure aircraft, and low-loss RF cables. The system was activated days after the release in orbit of UNISAT-7 and first 3D fix occurred shortly after its cold start in space. System performances were verified against 3D positions calculated using NORAD two-line-elements (TLE) and SGP4 propagators. An algorithm was implemented at ground to recreate a TLE based on several fix data obtained by the system in space, to pose the grounds for an automated computation of TLEs directly in space, on next GAUSS' small-satellite missions. This work will delve into ground testing, customized board preparation for flight, IOD mission and comparative results between the data sourced from the boarded GNSS solution and NORAD TLE orbital data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:15","2025-11-07 22:06:15","","","","","2022-September","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

With the existence of IoT, it can facilitate and make human activities efficient. To receive the IoT information, the satellite requires a wireless communication module. The Long Range (LoRa) module is considered capable of dealing with these needs and has great potential, because LoRa is capable of transferring small to large data, as well as low power consumption, besides that LoRa can be placed on nano satellite, namely Cube Satellite (CubeSat). In this study, a microstrip antenna was designed which was placed on CubeSat 1U. The resulting microstrip antenna is capable of receiving LoRa and works in the 920 - 923 MHz frequency range with a center frequency of 921.5 MHz. This antenna is designed using rectangular patch method Multiple Layer Substrate to increase gain. The substrate material used is FR-4.

The proposed antenna array is characterized by characteristic mode analysis (CMA). One single element of the CP octagonal-ring slot antenna array consists of a C-shaped monopole on the upper layer functioning as the radiating patch; and an octagonal-ring slot patch on the lower layer functioning as the ground plane. The four elements are connected by a sequentially-rotated feed network to enhance the impedance bandwidth (IBW), axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW), and gain. Simulations are performed, and an antenna prototype is fabricated and experiments carried out. The measured IBW and ARBW at the center frequency of 2.4 GHz are 91.6% (1.8 - 4 GHz) and 84.5% (1.97 - 4 GHz), with the maximum gain of 7.8 dBic at 3.3 GHz, rendering the proposed four-element CP octagonal-ring slot antenna array with sequentially-rotated feed network operationally suitable for S-band satellite communication.

Plastic CubeSats are appealing candidates. To enable the use of this new generation of space systems, the challenge of designing suitable communication sub-systems must be faced. In this work, a 3Dprinted ABS antenna easily embeddable in a plastic CubeSat is proposed. The 3D-printed material has been characterized in terms of dielectric, mechanical and thermal properties, and the compliance with space requirements has been assessed. In particular, thermogravimetric and calorimetric tests have been carried out. Static and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed. To comply with the stringent weight and space requirements, the unique antenna design of a curved stacked patch has been proposed. The patch covers the uplink (2.025-2.11 GHz) and downlink (2.2-2.29 GHz) bands for Telemetry Tracking and Command (TT&C) applications, with an overall bandwidth of about 300 MHz (14%). Additionally, taking advantage of the curved shape, the proposed antenna shows a size reduction of the resonant length of about 34%. The size of the antenna is 71.5 71.5 13 mm3 and is characterized by a weight of only 51 g. Also, in silico tests, by relying on the measured physical properties and a non-linear numerical model, have been carried out to assess the performances of the final antenna layout during a typical CubeSat mission. The proposed design strategy could be used to develop plastic CubeSats embedding performing antennas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:15","2025-11-07 22:06:15","","1351-1363","","","3","","IEEE Open J.

The bandwidth improvement comes from two meshed square patches that are placed on top of each other and have two close resonance frequencies. The first design consists of two Fused Silica glass substrates with an overall height of 5 mm in which the first layer acts as both antenna's substrate and solar cell cover glass. The antenna demonstrates an impedance bandwidth of 6.1%, peak gain of 6.9 dBi, and efficiency higher than 90%. The results were a motivation for further exploration of the performance of the stacked antenna with a sacrificial polymer material between two patches resulting in a lightweight antenna. The second antenna is lighter by 30% at the expense of lower efficiency. Further weight reduction is applied by partially removing the sacrificial polymer.

To realize a wide axial ratio (AR) bandwidth with a compact size, a sequentially rotated feeding network was designed by modifying a quadrature hybrid coupler and a rat-race coupler that has a small change in phase difference even when the frequency changes. A wideband CP patch array antenna was designed by combining a C-shaped slot-coupled solar cell patch in conjunction with a novel feeding network. The overall size of the proposed CP CubeSat antenna is 100 × 100×7.2 mm3 (0.83 λo × 0.83 λo × 0.06 λo at 2.5 GHz). Solar cells occupy 79% of the antenna area, enabling efficient energy harvesting. The -10 dB impedance bandwidth is 1.98-3.0 GHz, which is a fractional bandwidth of approximately 41.0%. The 3-dB AR and 3-dB gain bandwidths are 1.98-3.0 GHz (41.0%) and 1.82-2.98 GHz (46.6%), respectively.

Also, for achieving circular polarization two shapes were considered, a corner truncated square patch and a nearly square patch.

With limited space, reliable and efficient high bandwidth antenna systems are needed for current and next-generation wireless technology as well as for the revolutionary small satellites. The fifth generation of mobile communication technology promises high data rates, low latency and good spectrum efficiency. One of the key enablers of this technology is the integration of satellite technology-particularly CubeSats with terrestrial communication technologies. Next-generation antennas that can meet functional requirements for 5G and CubeSat applications are therefore of fundamental importance. These antenna systems should have large bandwidth, high gain and efficiency and be compact in size. Reconfigurable antennas can provide different configurations in terms of the operating frequency, radiation pattern and polarization. Tuning reconfigurable antennas can be done by changing the physical parameters of the antenna elements through electronic switches, optical switches and the use of meta-materials. The most popular implementation method for reconfigurable antennas for wireless and satellite communication is the electronic switching method due to its high reliability, efficiency, and ease of integration with microwave circuitry. In this article, different techniques for implementing reconfigurable and multi-band antennas are reviewed, with emphasis on two main application areas; 5G wireless communication and CubeSat application. Different reconfiguration techniques have been studied for application in various wireless communication systems such as satellite communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, cognitive radio and 5G communication. It has been found that reconfigurable antennas have favourable properties for next-generation wireless technology and small satellites. These properties include low cost, less volume requirements and good isolation between wireless standards. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","40910-40931","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 67; Correspondence Address: K.

The inductive coupling between the middle and innermost ring enhances the bandwidth as well as improves the isolation. The antenna structure exhibits (13.2–14.49 GHz) 9.25% impedance bandwidth with 24 dB isolation at 13.7 GHz. The realized broadside gain at the resonant frequency is 9.22 dBi.

Passive RF tags do not require a battery, but operate by harvesting energy from an RF signal emitted by a reader and communicate by modulating the signal scattered from its antenna. Therefore, they consume very little power and can operate without a battery. This paper discusses the design of a passive backscatter RF tag for use on the Radio Frequency Tag Satellite (RFTSat), a 3U cubesat that was designed and launched by a team of undergraduate students. The paper presents the design of the tag's energy harvester, microstrip patch antennas, and discusses the sensors included on the tag. The paper concludes by presenting the data collected from the RF tag while in orbit. This scientific sensing experiment also proves to be the first in-orbit demonstration of space solar power where microwave energy is collected and used as the sole power source for an electrical system performing useful work in space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","307-317","","","6","","IEEE J.

The antenna is designed for the Ku band and a peak gain of 18.0 dBi is achieved within the impedance bandwidth from 11.75 GHz to 12.75 GHz. Wide bandwidth is achieved as the patch elements are excited through E-shaped slots having asymmetric side lengths and widths. Each square patch element of the array with truncated corners and appropriately placed slots generates right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation with very high cross-polarization discrimination. A corporate feed network consisting of T-junctions and quarter-wave impedance transformers is developed to feed the array elements from a single coaxial port of 50 Ω. To improve the radiation from the patches and wave-guiding in the feed network, two types of Rogers substrates with different dielectric constant and thickness are considered. Our proposed microstrip patch array antenna of size 7.8 cm × 6.4 cm × 0.3 cm can perform efficiently with a downlink data rate as high as 4.6 Gbps for small satellites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","47-56","","1","68","","Int.

Due to the introduction of the CLS, the unit patch element becomes multi-resonant and miniaturized. Besides, the outer length and width of the CLS are one-to-one related to the length of the patch. As a result, more than 480° phase range with quite good linearity is achieved. In addition, the phase ranges are almost parallel to each other from 22.5-26.5 GHz, which signifies its broadband property. Using such 36× 36 CLS patches in a square aperture of 180 mm ×180 mm size, an offset-fed reflectarray is constructed for an off-broadside radiation pattern. A prototype has been fabricated to experimentally validate the numerical results obtained using CST full-wave simulations. The measurement results exhibit a broad 1-dB gain bandwidth of 17.6% (22.44-26.78 GHz) and a peak gain of 32.2 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 60.6%. Moreover, both the cross-pol and side-lobe levels (SLLs) remain more than 40 dB and 21 dB, respectively, below the peak co-pol level throughout the 1-dB gain bandwidth. The proposed reflectarray can be used as a CubeSat antenna for K-band inter-satellite links (ISL). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","13490-13495","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: D.

The antenna is based on a multi-layer element structure consisting of two dielectric substrates made of Taconic TLY-5 and three copper layers (i.e., the parasitic patch (top layer), the active patch (middle layer), and the ground plane (bottom layer)). The parasitic patch resides on the bottom surface of the upper TLY-5 substrate while the active patch is printed on the top surface of the lower substrate. A Rohacell foam material is sandwiched between the top layer and the middle layer to separate the two dielectric substrates in order to achieve high directivity, wideband, and to keep the antenna weight to a minimum as required by the SAR satellite application. To satisfy the required size of the antenna panel for the small SAR satellite, an asymmetric corporate feeding network (CFN) is designed to feed a 12 × 16 planar array antenna. However, it was determined that the first corporate feed junction at the center of the CFN, where higher amplitudes of the input signal are located, contributes significantly to the leaky wave emission, which degrades the radiation efficiency and increases the sidelobe level. Thus, a suspended microstrip slab, which is simply a wide and long microstrip line, is designed and positioned on the top layer directly above that feed junction to prevent the leaky waves from radiating. The experimental results of the antenna show good agreement with the simulated ones, achieving an impedance bandwidth of 12.4% from 9.01 to 10.20 GHz and a high gain above 28 dBi. The antenna efficiency estimated from the gain and directivity eclipses 51.34%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","","","1","22","","Sensors","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.-O.

Distinguished from conventional arrays formed by identical elements, the proposed one is based on sequential rotation-fed concentric annular aperture elements. By adjusting the excitation phase, magnitude, and polarization of each annular aperture element, the radiation patterns of the array can be shaped to form isoflux beams. Radiation pattern modeling method is developed to obtain array radiation parameters. Besides, to effectively characterize the impedance matching of the radiators of the array with multiple excitations, an overall reflection coefficient is deduced from signal decomposition. A prototype operating at C -band (5 GHz) is designed, fabricated, and measured. It consists of a radiator and a feeding network. The radiator is formed by two annular aperture elements, of which the inner one is realized by a circular patch antenna while the outer one is formed by eight planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs). The feeding network drives annular aperture elements in the manner of sequential rotation. In this way, a CP isoflux beam array with a low profile ( 0.078~{\lambda }_{0}) , lightweight, and ease-of-integration for CubeSat is realized.

Accordingly, the performance demand on these volume- and power-limited satellites have drastically increased in the recent years. The demand for higher data throughput capabilities has been increasing, so more CubeSats are choosing S- and X-band communication options in order to meet the increasing data rates. Due to the limitations on link margin for CubeSats, use of S- and/or X-band necessitates a higher-gain, directional antenna. The main problem is that these antennas require accurate attitude determination and pointing, which can often become power-, volume-, and cost-prohibitive for CubeSat projects. The method proposed uses a permanent magnet to passively orient the satellite antenna towards the nadir direction. For satellites contacting higher-latitude ground stations, aligning the patch antenna in the direction of the magnetic dipole is enough to acquire the ground station within its half-power beamwidth. This research investigates the feasibility of using a permanent magnet onboard a CubeSat to passively point the antenna towards the ground station in the absence of other active attitude control systems. The study characterizes the expected communication link performance for a typical 3U CubeSat when implementing the proposed communication architecture using a S- or X-band patch antenna. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","","","","2021-March","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Aerosp.

The proposed antenna combines an aperture coupled feeding with a T-slot, four metallic vias and a patch with a diagonal slot to present high gain and wide 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth (BW) characteristics. In this study, a rectangular patch (0.6 λ<inf>0</inf> × 0.5 λ<inf>0</inf> at f = 7.5 GHz) with a diagonal slot has been symmetrically located above the T-slot at the height of 0.07 λ<inf>0</inf>.

The effect of the solar cell on the antenna was analyzed and validated. The impact of the antenna on the efficiency of the solar cell was quantified through experiments. It has been found that while the active semiconductor junction in a solar cell severely reduces the gain of the antenna in many space communication bands, the electrode lattice in the solar cell can potentially act as an isolation between the solar cell and the antenna, preventing the gain worsening. The effect of the lattice also promises a potential application in lab-grown solar cells such that one may carefully design the size and number of the electrodes to ensure the best gain for the integrated antenna. The main factor that impacts the efficiency of the solar cells was found to be the cover glass rather than the shadow from the antenna. These results can serve as design guidelines when integrating optically transparent antennas on solar panels of small satellites to reduce payload and to achieve reliable communication link. One may balance the selection of solar cells, cover glass, and antenna geometry to achieve the optimal link budget. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:16","2025-11-07 22:06:16","","1734-1739","","3","69","","IEEE Trans Antennas Propag","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: R.

This paper puts forth the study, done through simulations, of the impact of a massive reflecting sail on the operation of a system of antennas and changes in link time associated with the COEPSAT-2 mission. The solar sail under consideration is a large 40 square meter reflective film made of a polymer substrate, providing a reflectivity of around 90 per cent, which causes changes in the antenna radiation pattern, gain, VSWR and beam width. The system of antennas to be employed in COEPSAT-2 comprises a pair of dipole antennas for data uplink and downlink and a rectangular microstrip patch antenna for GPS signal reception. Due to the reflecting nature of the solar sail, the omnidirectional radiation patterns of the dipole antennas obtain directional properties. Besides, the orientations of the satellite are so chosen as to assist solar sailing and are not typically favorable for communication. Nonetheless, addition of the sail shows an increase in the maximum gain of all the antennas and their corresponding half-power beam width angle. Consequently, there is a significant improvement in the communication link percentage (ratio of link time to pass time) - from around 35 per cent to nearly 100 per cent. The communication feasibility has been inferred from the link time and link budget analysis. The link time has been obtained from simulations performed for different TLEs (two-line element set) of the satellite over one year for nadir pointing and orbit raising orientations. A comparative analysis of the antenna parameters before and after the deployment of sail and its subsequent effect on the link budget and link time is presented and the results are corroborated by extensive simulations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","","","","E2","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

A method to detect debris could be to use space-based passive bistatic radar (PBR). The STRATHcube project proposes to launch a CubeSat into LEO as a PBR technology demonstrator where a signal processing algorithm developed at the University of Strathclyde to detect space debris will be tested. The concept involves a radar receiver and antenna on-board a CubeSat orbiting at a low altitude to detect the radio signals transmitted by operational satellites orbiting at higher altitudes. These signals may have been modified by an object orbiting between the operational satellites and the CubeSat and therefore would indicate a piece of debris exists. This paper will present the integration of PBR technology onto a CubeSat as a payload on the STRATHcube mission and discuss the challenges faced due to the limitations of the small platform. The use of a custom-built 3D antenna and an off-the-shelf patch antenna are investigated as design options for the payload. A high-level design for each option was completed to evaluate their capabilities on the size of trackable debris and to determine their mass and power parameters. After an extensive trade-off analysis at a system level, carried out to narrow down the options of the PBR payload on the CubeSat platform, it was determined that the patch antenna option presented the best way of facilitating the experiment onboard the CubeSat due to its small size and mass. The completed design of the STRATHcube mission will enable an in-orbit demonstration of the PBR technology, which if successful, will provide an alternative to conventional ground-based tracking that is cheaper and more available to the space community. This method would then be proven to industry who can use this approach to implement on a larger scale in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","","","","A6","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This development philosophy makes it possible to realize a smaller, better, faster and cost-effective small satellite constellation with the advantage of being able to perform missions quickly through a short revisit time. Small SAR Technology Experimental Project (S-STEP) is to develop 80kg-class ultra-light weight X-band active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite constellation system with an additional function of S-band Inter Satellite Link (ISL). The mission applications are focused on observation of inland/coastal region, geological mapping, environment and disaster monitoring, marine surveillance for ship and pollution detection. The S-STEP system with unique mechanical configuration of flat platetype satellite provides a high resolution of 1 m stripmap mode, ScanSAR mode with 4 m resolution and VideoSAR mode with 1 m resolution for identification of moving target. As a SAR payload, aperture-coupled cavity-backed microstrip patch array antenna with high-gain was considered in the system design. The S-STEP has innovatively reduced the total mass of satellite by adopting design strategy of multi-functional integrated structure. For example, Transmit/Receive (TR) module for active SAR mission is also used as structural stiffener and heat dissipation radiator to guarantee a long-term image acquisition of 120 sec regardless of left and right looking mission due to a novel passive thermal design of TR module. The main feature of the system is to adopt a strategy of whole spacecraft vibration isolation to decrease the total mass of satellite by reducing the launch design load. This also contributes to reduce a development cost and schedule of the project by optimizing the conventional verification process which takes a large portion of the time and cost in entire satellite development programs. In addition, the new design concept of satellite with bus and payload integrated structure makes it possible to achieve a high-dimensional stability of the structure with SAR antenna under severe on-orbit thermal environment. In this paper, S-STEP mission, system design, development philosophy and innovative thermo-mechanical design will be introduced to demonstrate the feasibility of the design approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","","","","B4","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The antennas remain in a stowed configuration during launch and are deployed once the satellite reaches orbit. The deployment mechanism is designed to deploy the antenna in the required orientation and minimize potential failures. Material and stiffness for the antenna have been finalized considering several factors such as requirement, availability, and success rate of deployment. Principles used to decide the spring for deployment doors have been described in the paper. It has been ensured that the door remains locked in its position after deployment. Impact due to collision of the deployment doors with the satellite structure has also been computed. Ample measures have been taken to prevent deployment failure due to cold welding in space. The antennas have also been electrically insulated from the rest of the structure of the satellite. The contour for support of stowed antennas has been designed to minimize the stress acting on the stowed antenna to prevent deformation of the antenna. Space optimization considerations, among other factors, are described in this paper. A burn-wire mechanism has been used for deploying the antennas at the appropriate time. A feedback mechanism has also been integrated into the circuit to signal the successful deployment of the antennas. The deployment process was also tested on 3D printed models of the designed antenna deployment system to check for possible errors and the reliability of the feedback mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","","","","C2","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The adopted folding and shorting technique for the individual patch elements, allows for size reduction of the conventional quarter-wavelength shorted patch. Also, to further miniaturize the array, the single-element FSPs are realized with meandering on the top-layer. These design approaches result in a compact array with a total size of 5 × 5 cm2 considering a 2 × 2 arrangement. This structure also offers dual-circularly polarized (DCP) radiation which is made possible by an eight-port feeding configuration for the array (i.e. two ports for each element). Given the dual-band nature of the individual FSPs, which is not typically exploited, the developed array is made operational for 1.1 GHz and 2.1 GHz. These features can simultaneously allow for downlink and uplink communications and/or satellite-to-satellite data links at L-band and S-band frequencies, while also, not consuming excessive area on the satellite itself.

The space industry is increasingly shifting to the use of smaller spacecraft and payloads at different phases of the mission, as opposed to the traditional large systems. While the use of small satellites broadens the limits of distinct space operations in terms of size, power, cost and mass budget, they present limitations in terms of communications coverage and performance. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) offer excellent capabilities for short range applications that present high data throughput requirements. As lunar missions are being currently developed as means to do preliminary tests for deep space exploration, small satellite-based capabilities are being considered for their tasks. Considering this increase in lunar presence, the space industry is embracing well known and widely used WLAN standards, such as the standardized and ubiquitous IEEE 802.11, to create a communications and navigation network architecture similar to terrestrial Wi-Fi networks and as robust as possible to accommodate lunar mission requirements. In this work, an antenna system design, analysis, simulation, manufacturing and testing to use 5 GHz 802.11 WLAN capabilities in lunar surface applications are presented. Antenna design simulations are performed using Ansys HFSS and the analysis of the performance of the system is evaluated using Ansys SBR+. The design considers a small satellite payload being deployed from a lunar lander with two truncated-corner probe-fed (TCPF) patch antennas in both the lander and the payload sides. Simulations and measurements of the designs present peak gain values of 14.8 dBi and 8.2 dBi for the lander and the payload configurations, respectively, and link losses, including antennas, path loss and environment, lower than 50 dB at a range of 20 m. The system presents a link margin of approximately 30 dB for longer range applications, and beamsteerable capabilities adding a phase shift component. It offers a low-cost, low-weight, low-profile solution for small spacecrafts for lunar surface applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","97-102","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

In this framework, the use of Ka-band for communication is explored. We present the design of a stacked patch antenna working across the down-and uplink Ka-bands. Materials and geometry of the radiator have been selected by accounting for the trade-off between electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical requirements. The design of the antenna is performed with a particle swarm optimization algorithm developed to control the bandwidth and matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. Furthermore, a multiphysics thermal analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized array, mounted on a 1 U satellite, in a case-study mission. The temperature patterns in the array are evaluated during the orbital period, and the influence of the operative temperature on the antenna responses and gain was considered. We found that the thermal loads can affect the antenna matching. However, thanks to the optimized design, the proposed stacked antenna can operate from-100 ^{\circ }C to 100 ^{\circ }C, with an almost constant gain. Finally, following a damage-Tolerant approach, the level of mechanical deformation, which could be induced on the communication system, was studied. The stress analysis reveals that the stacked geometry can be used in a space mission. From the investigation of the strain and displacement field, we found a negligible impact on the antenna performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","143-157","","","6","","IEEE J.

This paper presents an ultrawideband circularly polarized two-layer crossed-dipole microstrip antenna for S-band CubeSat applications using genetic algorithms optimization tools included in the 3D electromagnetic simulation software Ansys HFSS. The antenna is constructed on a 10 × 10 cm Cuclad-250 substrate with a back copper flat plane, located at /4 at 2.25 GHz operating frequency. The backplane with the exact substrate dimensions improves gain and reduces inside satellite radiation.

The proposed metal-only antenna mainly consists of an upper patch, a folded ramp-shaped patch and shoring pins connecting the antenna with the ground plane. By adjusting the lengths and widths of two arms of the upper F-shaped patch, a second resonant frequency is generated, and hence, the −10 dB bandwidth is increased. Moreover, the effect of arms’ lengths and widths on reflection coefficients, operating frequency and bandwidth is presented. To validate the design and the simulation results, a prototype metal-only patch antenna was fabricated and tested in a Chamber. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results is achieved. The measured results show that the fabricated prototype achieves a −10 dB bandwidth of 44.9% (1.6–2.7 GHz), a small reflection coefficient of −24.4 dB and a high efficiency, i.e., 85% at 2.45 GHz.

Smart panel technology that provides both mechanical and electrical functionality is a beneficial solution to spacecraft miniaturization. Combining different subsystems that are usually developed independently of each other is an innovative approach to space system design. Embedding antennas within satellite structural components reduces the overhead required for integrating numerous systems and maximizes space for the payload and other critical instruments. Microstrip patch antennas provide a low profile, light weight, small-dimension and easily manufactured solution to small satellite communication. The phased array functionality of the antenna enables dynamic beamforming for maximum versatility. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of an embedded phased array microstrip patch antenna with a hybrid composite structural panel comprised of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite (CFC), Polyethylene fiber reinforcedpolyethylene composite (PFC) (HDPE), and aluminium, with SU-8 as the antenna substrate. The embedded antenna panels are designed to be adaptable for any function and size required by the end user. We present the design of the smart panel antenna modelled using electromagnetic simulation software. The CFC and PFC materials are modelled with approximations of their electrical properties derived from experimental S-parameter and impedance measurements. The simulated antenna's radiation performance such as half power beamwidth, efficiency and gain are evaluated. The performance characteristics of the simulated antenna design are used to evaluate its application and feasibility in systems integration, and different uses in case studies including radar mapping spacecraft, satellite constellations, and CubeSats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:17","2025-11-07 22:06:17","","51-56","","","175","","Acta Astronaut","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: V.

The satellite offers numerous payloads alongside the satellite bus, all of which might be used by an OPS-SAT experiment. The unpredictable nature of experiments with respect to the use of payload components raises certain unknowns, in particular concerning power consumption. As a result, the thermal behaviour throughout the satellite depends largely on which of the several on-board experiments and the associated payloads are switched on. OPS-SAT offers a variety of communication modules, such as a UHF transceiver, an S-Band transceiver, a Software Defined Radio (SDR), an X-Band transmitter and an optical receiver. The peak power consumption of OPS-SAT may exceed 30 watts during high power experiments. The S-Band transceiver consumes up to 10 watts during ground station passes and the so-called Satellite Experimental Processing Platform (SEPP), the heart of OPS-SAT experiments, consumes up to 8 watts constantly. This work provides an overview of the design and the thermal considerations on OPS-SAT and the results of the thermal vacuum (TVAC) test campaign. The results yield an average thermo-optical emissivity of 0.79 to 0.84 and the thermal power distribution on the spacecraft surface, and demonstrate the special case of the thermally isolated S-Band and X-Band patch antennas. Based on the derived results, predictions can be made about the thermal behaviour during various load cases and during periods with an active S-Band transmitter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:18","2025-11-07 22:06:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CoBCom - Int.

The PRETTY mission focuses on the characterisation of the surface height.

The printed antenna is mechanically adjustable to realize three functional states at different operating frequencies in the L-band and S-band respectively. Three different angle deployments are proposed at 10°, 50° and 90°, so that the antenna operates at three different operating frequencies, namely 1.3 GHz (L-band), 2.4 GHz (S-band) and 3 GHz (S-band). The measured results of the fabricated antenna are well matched with the simulation, having frequencies of 2.82–3.07 GHz, 1.3–1.4 GHz and 2.38–2.57 GHz, with similar radiation patterns. The measured gain of the antenna is 8.167 dBi at 2.4 GHz, 5.278 dBi at 1.3 GHz and 6.120 dBi at 3 GHz. Keeping within the general theme of cheap off the shelf components for CubeSats, this antenna design allows the CubeSat designers to choose from three popular frequencies, through a simple angle configuration. The main contribution of this work lies with the reconfigurable frequency, relatively high gain and simplicity of design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:18","2025-11-07 22:06:18","","","","6","9","","Electronics (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: S.

The array utilizes folded-shorted patches (FSPs) and printed circuit board (PCB) technology for antenna miniaturization. Both techniques enable a size decrease of the quarter-wavelength shorted-patch by a factor of 1/N, where N is number of the layers above the ground plane while maintaining a quarter-wavelength resonant length. This results in a reduction of the antenna length by half or more.

The objective for the antenna is to detect signals originating from the Dark Ages, which are expected to be between 80 kHz and 30 MHz. For this, antennas are needed with a large effective aperture to increase the sensitivity as well as to be sensitive to the low frequency signals, and which still fit inside a CubeSat. One of the ways to deploy a large structure which is packed in a small volume during launch, is by using inflatable antennas. Previous work has shown the feasibility of using inflatable antennas as reflector antennas. The novelty in this work is the study on the use of the inflatable antenna as an observational antenna instead of a directive reflector antenna. Here the radiating active antenna elements are printed on the thin membrane. An analysis is done on usable antenna designs that can be used for the application and specifically for these inflatable structures. Next an analysis on the possible practical implementation of such a system is done including but not limited to the material the membrane, method of inflation and folding techniques. In the end, a possible design is shown, which uses 8 sinuous antennas on very thin PVE film with a conductive coating. A scale model using generic cost-effective PCB material is shown which will be further investigated and tested. Future research will demonstrate an actual practical test. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:18","2025-11-07 22:06:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Aerosp.

As the transmitter uses a patch antenna with an opening angle of eighty degrees for downlink, the satellite needs to be orientated towards the ground station for data transmission. Considering the moderate pointing requirements, attitude control was implemented as fully passive system based on a permanent magnet and a hysteresis plate in order to limit the complexity of the spacecraft. However, Sun sensors and gyroscopes were implemented to allow for an evaluation of the attitude alignment while passing the ground station. After the launch of BEESAT-3 in April 2013, no whatsoever signal could be received from the spacecraft. However, after nearly five years in orbit, in January 2018, the first successful contact to the satellite could be established and after a significant upgrade of the ground station antenna all mission objectives could be met in the subsequent months.

The integrated system occupies a Cubesat volume of 0.25U employing an integrated transceiver, an up-down converter, and a chain of beamforming circuits to manage the phase and gain its elements. The array's elements are slot coupled microstrip antennas etched on an asymmetric PTFE substrate stack and have a 10dB impedance bandwidth of 900MHz, with a maximal 25dB return loss at 24GHz. Circular polarization is made possible by using a cross slot geometry. The beamforming technology is scalable, low-power, lightweight and made from commercially-off-the-shelf components requiring 0.5W for each 16-element at maximum gain. The transceiver technology is to be used at the C6 System Integration and Engine Test. Link budget estimates show that integrating the developed phased array with an existing ground station, having an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and gain-to-noise-temperature (G/T) of 41.5dBW and 4.7dB/K, results in improved data links compared to omnidirectional antennas from launchpad to low earth orbit.

Various communication modes integrated in one single system on small satellite is becoming a challenge. In order to compatible different communication modes, the reconfigurable antenna in space/frequency domain is becoming one of the core technologies for satellite communications. There is one common problem for the application of satellite antenna: with the increasing of the numbers of devices on earth the signal reception becomes impossible with low-directivity antennas. However, antenna typical for high-directivity often have fixed beam or frequency band, reconfigurable antenna with high-directivity is seldomly researched. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a lens-loaded reconfigurable framework to realize high-directivity reconfigurable in both space domain and frequency domain for satellite communication applications. The proposed lens-loaded reconfigurable antenna consists of a 3D-printed spherical lens and an array of frequency recconfigurable feed array located on its focal plane. This paper gives the overall structure and work principle of the high-directivity reconfigurable antenna. The antenna is simulated by full-wave EM simulation software CST. The directivity, beamscanning, and isolation performances are estimated. The directivity is range from 17.7 to 23.1dBi and 18.9 to 22.2dBi at low and high reconfigurable frequency bands, the beam scanning of over 30° is achieved. The analysis results show that the improvement of antenna gain is over 17.8dB by loading spherical lens on the reconfigurable feed antenna in the normal direction, approximately 60 times than the conventional reconfigurable antenna. The design issues, analysis processes and the potential applications on satellite communication of the proposed antenna are presented in detail.

The innovations and miniaturization of technology has enabled low cost deep space missions which were not possible before. The new space has commercial outlook, and this is the reason why private money will inflow soon into this industry. Having a human space history and a lot of useful resources, moon has become a very strategic celestial body for human space exploration. Space agencies like ESA has publicly declared to build and support Moon Village and NASA has started an initiative called COTS (Commercial Orbit Transport Service) with a view to have a cooperative effort of public and private sector to do space exploration. Many studies regarding different lunar architectures like communication, mining, etc. have been studied and are being studied to estimate challenges and risks of such missions. This paper will explain the communication architecture required to support lunar infrastructure development. The expected performance of lunar relay constellation would be explained based on link budget calculations. Different orbit manoeuvres with selected lunar orbit and its importance will be addressed in this paper. Based on link budget calculations a functional block diagram of a communication system RF front end is discussed and prototype is developed. The communication system prototype is designed for CubeSat missions.

Six years ago, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities, with one of the key thrusts being the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 meter, 35 GHz antenna in a 1.5U canister. At that time, there had been very limited development in the area of high gain CubeSat antennas which are critical for both high data rate communications and remote sensing science. A Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. This paper discusses the process of building, integrating, and operating the flight antenna, its final performance and lessons learned. KaPDA was an enabling technology for RainCube mission, the first Earth Science CubeSat to have an active instrument. RainCube was launched in May of 2018, making KaPDA the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat and the first of its kind to operate at Ka-band enabling a number of opportunities for high rate, deep space antenna communications and remote sensing science. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:18","2025-11-07 22:06:18","","","","","1 PartF","","","","","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIAA Scitech Forum","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 7; Conference name: AIAA Scitech Forum, 2020; Conference location: Orlando; FL</p>","","","Aviation; California Institute of Technology; Communication capabilities; Data communication rate; Enabling technologies; High data rate communications; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Orbits; Parabolic antennas; Remote sensing; Research and Technology Development; Slot antennas; Small satellites; Space optics; University research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper two reconfigurable filtennas are presented to integrate mobile devices that communicate (uplink and downlink) with satellites in low-orbit constellations. A microstrip patch antenna in uplink mode (29 GHz), is surrounded by copper structure that, once connected via a PIN diode, takes the antenna to resonate in a lower frequency band (20 GHz). To deal with both bands, two filters were integrated into the radiating structure: edge-coupled and hairpin filters. The antennas were characterized and compared through simulation and measurements, in terms of impedance adaptation, radiation pattern and isolation between operating bands, validating their operability. Their small size and low cost allow these antennas to be integrated into mobile terminals that communicate with satellites or 5G systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-07 22:06:18","2025-11-07 22:06:18","","77179-77187","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: L.

The antenna array was designed at a center frequency of 5.5 GHz, and it has a two-port isolation bandwidth of 25 MHz above 20 dB while the axial ratio is below 1 dB. The main objective is to produce a four-patch antenna array to be mounted on CubeSat deployable wings along with a layer of solar panels, maximizing the usable space and obtaining a better link budget for a standardized Cubesat of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm. The orthogonal feedlines' isolation between Tx/Rx signals and a minimization of the multi-layer design provide a lower profile approach considering the state-of-the-art. The significant thickness reduction combined with a new perspective of having both deployable wings transmitting and receiving signals lead to a notable improvement of the overall system.

The qualification of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) GPS receivers is discussed, and flight results of precise orbit and attitude determination are presented. Pseudorange and carrier phase errors amount to roughly 65 cm and 8 mm for the ionosphere-free dual-frequency combination, which compares favorably with other missions using fully qualified space GPS receivers and is mainly limited by choice of simple patch antennas without choke rings. Precise orbit determination of CASSIOPE using GPS observations can achieve decimeter-level accuracy during continued operations but suffers from onboard and mission restrictions that limit the typical data availability to less than 50% of each day and induce regular long-duration gaps of 4–10 h. Based on overlap analyses, daily peak orbit determination errors can, however, be confined to 1 m 3D on 84% of all days, which fulfills the mission needs for science data processing of other instruments. The attitude of CASSIOPE can be determined with a representative precision of about 0.2° in the individual axes using three GAP receivers and antennas.

A literature search suggests that most microstrip antenna designs are resonant for either RFID circuits around 900 MHz or for microwave frequencies at 2.4 GHz or above. This means that no design is readily available for the popular bands for satellite telemetry, the 145 MHz and 435 MHz amateur bands.

The requirements for nanosatellite antenna have physical specifications, such as lightweight, thin layer and small size with length and width smaller than or equal to 100 mm × 100 mm and electrical specification, such as the axial ratio (AR) lower than 3-dB, reflection coefficient (S-{11}) lower than -10 dB. The proposed antenna is simulated based on computer simulation technology (CST) simulator with single proximity-coupled feeding, single patch. The proposed antenna consists of the ground with a circular and rectangular slotted patch on the upper side and the shifted feed line at the bottom side. Between the ground patch and the feeding line have a substrate which has a dielectric constant of 2.17, the dissipation factor of 0.0005 and dielectric thickness of 1.6 mm. The analysis is performed by varying the length (l), width (w) and form (F) such as rectangular, circular and elliptical of the parasitic patch on upper side.

The low-profile requirements lead to a strong back radiation from the coupling aperture. Instead of suppressing the resulting electric field in the feeding stripline, an advantageous field distribution is used to boost the electromagnetic coupling to the radiating element. This effect is achieved by enclosing the stripline feeding structure with vertical conductive walls, effectively creating a cavity. The obtained antenna has a low profile of 0.08~lambda 0 at 2 GHz and exhibits 3 dB gain and axial ratio bandwidths of 27% and 32%, respectively. The effect of cavity resonances is analyzed in detail and we show how it is used to reduce the interference in adjacent frequency bands. This communication also proposes an elegant method of integrating this type of antennas into the satellite chassis, which reduces the antenna extrusion on the satellite surface.

These beacons transmit unmodulated, phase-coherent waves in S-band frequencies. Many satellite applications require circularly polarized (CP) wideband antennas. Their compact size, lightweight, and simple fabrication method make CP antennas suitable for small satellite systems. The slot antenna has wideband impedance, but the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) is narrower compared to the impedance bandwidth (IBW). In this paper, a circularly polarized circular-slotted antenna (CSA) is proposed to enhance the ARBW and the antenna gain. A pair of asymmetrical rectangular slots, a simple 50 W feedline and a parasitic patch were introduced to a CSA to enhance the 3 dB ARBW and the antenna gain. Rectangular slots were inserted on the diagonal axis of the CSA, the feedline was shifted to the left side of the x-axis, and a parasitic patch was attached to the circular slot. The lengths of the rectangular slots correspond to the resonant frequency, and the parasitic patch width corresponds to the higher frequency of the 3 dB ARBW. The asymmetrical rectangular slots, the shifted feedline, and the parasitic patch successfully improved the measured 3 dB ARBW of the antenna by 787.5 MHz or 35.79%. The measured gain of a CSA with left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) was also improved by shifting the feedline and the rectangular slot, achieving a peak gain of 5 dBic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","","","4","6","","Aerosp.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute support@mdpi.com","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: P.P.

In order to maintain approximately uniform effective signal strength on the surface of the earth, the radiation pattern of the antenna should be formed according to the shape of the earth. Former antennas for earth coverage purpose are either bulky or hard to realize the desired beam pattern within a wide angle range, making them unsuitable for small satellite applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel circularly polarized earth coverage antenna for spaceborne applications. The proposed antenna consists of a specially designed dielectric cylinder, in which a cavity backed patch antenna is embedded. With the help of the concave structure at the top of the dielectric cylinder, the refraction of electromagnetic wave can be controlled, and then the radiation pattern is shaped. A sequentially feeding network is designed to drive the antenna. To verify our concept, a prototype is fabricated and experiments are carried out. The simulation agrees well with the measurement. The earth coverage radiation pattern is obtained within the beamwidth of θ in the range of ±50° with the measured space axial ratio is better than 3 dB from 4.9 to 5.2 GHz.

The mission goal is to measure the Earth's surface by the use of passive reflectometry. Direct and reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are correlated to perform height measurements of the Earth surface, especially in polar regions. In addition, a miniaturized dosimeter payload quantifies the total ionizing dose as well as the linear energy transfer in the corresponding to the position in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This paper presents the design of the microstrip patch antenna array for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) passive reflectometry on the PRETTY CubeSat mission. The antenna allows the detection of both the direct signal and the reflected signal. Its antenna pattern is hence designed to have a high vertical aperture angle. To maximize the measurement performance, the perturbations and reflections outside the main lobe have to be kept as low as possible. Given these constraints, a 2x4 patch antenna array is used. The high gain of a patch array is required to provide sufficient amplification of the very weak GNSS-R signals, especially for the reflected ones. Based on the analysis results, a single element, as well as a 2x4 patch array, were designed with FEM simulation tools. Prototypes are manufactured and compared to the simulation results in terms of s-parameters, bandwidth, and gain. The results show a gain of over 13dB in the expected L1 frequency range and a bandwidth of about 10MHz. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","","","","2019-October","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Lunar IceCube will carry a Broadband InfraRed Compact High Resolution Exploration Spectrometer (BIRCHES) to estimate size and composition of water ice deposits on the Moon. Both missions carry the same telecommunication system composed by an Iris radio, an SSPA, an LNA, and two sets of transmitting and receiving low gain patch antennas (LGA) to be placed on opposite sides of the spacecraft to maximize coverage. The ground receivers for both missions are the 34 m Deep Space Network Stations located in Goldstone, Canberra, and Madrid plus the new affiliated Deep Space Station (DSS)-17 which is a 21 m dish located in Morehead (Kentucky) and managed by Morehead State University. Currently, both mission teams are focused on verifying compatibility between the telecommunication system and the ground stations through tests. The paper presents an overview of the missions and describes in details the efforts to verify compatibility and the results from the tests performed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","","","","2019-October","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Smart panel technology that provides both mechanical and electrical functionality is a beneficial solution to spacecraft miniaturization. Combining different subsystems that are usually developed independently of each other is an innovative approach to space system design. Embedding antennas within satellite structural components reduces the overhead required for integrating numerous systems and maximizes space for the payload and other critical instruments. Microstrip patch antennas provide a low profile, light weight, small-dimension and easily manufactured solution to small satellite communication. The phased array functionality of the antenna enables dynamic beamforming for maximum versatility. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of an embedded phased array microstrip patch antenna with a composite structural panel comprised of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and aluminium, with SU-8 as the antenna substrate. The embedded antenna panels are designed to be adaptable for any function and size required by the end user. We present the design of the smart panel antenna modelled using electromagnetic simulation software. The CFRP and HDPE materials are modelled with approximations of their electrical properties derived from experimental S-parameter and impedance measurements. The simulated antenna's radiation performance such as half power beamwidth, efficiency and gain are evaluated. The performance characteristics of the simulated antenna design are used to evaluate its application and feasibility in systems integration, and different uses in case studies including radar mapping spacecraft, satellite constellations, and CubeSats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","","","","2019-October","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Our mission is to image the whole world everyday, and make change visible, accessible, and actionable. We have launched over 300 satellites and built up an automated mission control and ground station infrastructure to monitor and control the satellites, and download the imagery data. The majority of these satellites are 3U cubesats known as “Doves”. Designing, building, and operating small satellites is replete with challenges, but one of particular interest is orbit determination. Independent orbit determination is an essential capability for responsibly operating small satellites. Public sources of ephemerides are known to be unreliable, especially during the launch and early operations phase of the mission as it is common for a given launch vehicle to deploy dozens of similar satellites in nearly identical orbits. Planet has invested in two independent, cooperative schemes for orbit determination: a time-of-flight ranging system using UHF radios and a GNSS-based system that uses the GPS L1 C/A signal. Unlike primary radar systems, both of these schemes are able to unambiguously identify each Dove. The Dove spacecraft is size, weight and power constrained. In the launch configuration, each satellite is roughly 30 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm with a mass of 5 kg. Volume constraints in particular made commercially available GNSS receiver modules unsuitable for this application. Since the Dove design already incorporated onboard compute and communication capabilities, we saw an opportunity to reuse those resources to provide a GNSS receiver solution. The only additional components that were needed for this receiver were a patch antenna, low-noise amplifier, SAW filter, and a GNSS RF front-end chipset. The volume, weight and power of these added components is 1 cm3, 1.5 g and 115 mW, respectively. Unlike most GNSS receivers, the Dove receiver does not provide real-time results. Rather, it works by way of taking short (32 ms) snapshots of the GPS L1 channel. These recordings are downlinked and post-processed using published GPS ephemerides and prior estimates of the satellite's orbits to obtain state vectors. GPS satellite geometry and received power are excellent from the Dove's nominal 500 km orbit (inside the Terrestrial Service Volume) which allows use of a small patch antenna. State vectors are ingested by our orbit-fitting service which in turn generates ephemerides for each of our satellites. An orbit model is fit to the GNSS state vectors via a non-linear least squares. The orbit model consists of a Cartesian state vector and ballistic coefficient numerically propagated under a force model with a GGM03C gravity field and the NRL-MSIS00 atmosphere model. The orbit fit process is run periodically against the most recent GNSS-derived state vectors. This entire processing flow is automated and runs on a scalable cloud compute solution. Moving GNSS sample processing off the satellite comes at the price of added latency to the orbit determination process. This is acceptable for our medium resolution (3.7 m Ground Sample Distance) imaging mission, however, it may not be applicable for systems with higher precision requirements or for missions with greater dynamics (e.g., satellites with propulsion capabilities). Nevertheless, it has proven to be a size, weight and power efficient approach for implementing GNSS reception on a small satellite. To date this solution has been used operationally on over 185 Dove satellites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","1157-1163","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Navigation","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This single element antenna achieves high gain by exploiting the mode superposition of TM<inf>11</inf> + TM<inf>13</inf> (excited by a circle of vias loading the cavity) and TM<inf>12</inf> + TM<inf>14</inf> (excited by the cavity itself) radiated from the two apertures, respectively. A simple feeding network, consisting of a quadrature hybrid and a couple of 90° bent branches, is used in the design to excite RHCP or LHCP mode in the antenna cavity. A capacitive disk feeding is implemented so that the antenna can be matched to the feeding network, and the super-positioned fields inside the cavity are not disturbed by the feeding pins. This approach makes the design of a dual-sense circularly polarized antenna with high gain easier since the array configuration is not needed. High gain, in combination with a dual-sense circular polarization, makes the proposed antenna particularly attractive for space applications involving small satellites. With the proposed design, it is possible to employ only one antenna rather than two (RHCP and LHCP), thus saving space on the aircraft, which is clearly a limited resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-07 22:06:19","2025-11-07 22:06:19","","74925-74930","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.

The proposed antenna is applied on nanosatellite for electron density and scintillation measurement of ionosphere. The requirements for nanosatel-lite antenna that will apply differential phase technique have specifications such as dual bands, circular polarization with axial ratio (AR) lower than 3 dB, reflection coefficient (S-{11}) lower than -10 dB, length and width of the antenna lower than or equal to 100\ \text{mm}\times 100\ \text{mm}. The proposed antenna is simulated based on computer simulation technology (CST) simulator with single proximity-coupled feeding, single patch, dual-band circularly-polarized microstrip antenna. The proposed antenna consists of ground and rectangular-formed radiating patch on the upper side with circularly-formed slot on the center of patch and the feeding line at bottom side. Between radiating patch, ground patch and feeding line have a substrate which have dielectric constant of 2.17, dissipation factor of 0.0005 and dielectric thickness of 1.6 mm. The investigation is performed by varying the length of feed line at bottom side and the size of parasitic rectangular patch at upper side. The length of feeding line has dominant effects to reflection coefficient of the lower band frequency and the size of parasitic small patch rectangular-formed have dominant effects to axial ratio on the higher band frequency. The characteristic of antenna parameters such as impedance bandwidth, axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) will be presented. From simulation result, the characteristic of proposed antenna has a good agreement between simulation and antenna requirements for nanosatellite antenna to transmit the beacon signal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-07 22:06:20","2025-11-07 22:06:20","","864-867","","","2018-August","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Prog.

Also, the obtained gain has a good value and it’s very remarkable according to the small size of the structure, with a peak value of 6.1 dBi at 12.5 GHz.

Nowadays, nanosatellites are being used to observe climate change using remote sensing technology. Communication between a remote sensing nanosatellite and Earth significantly depends upon antenna systems. Body-mounted solar panels are the main source of satellite operating power unless deployable solar panels are used. Lower ultra-high frequency (UHF) nanosatellite antenna design is a crucial challenge due to the physical size constraint and the need for solar panel integration. Moreover, nanosatellite space missions are vulnerable because of antenna and solar panel deployment complexity. This paper proposes a solar panel-integrated modified planner inverted F antenna (PIFA) to mitigate these crucial limitations. The antenna consists of a slotted rectangular radiating patch with coaxial probe feeding and a rectangular ground plane. The proposed antenna has achieved a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 6.0 MHz (447.5 MHz–453.5 MHz) with a smallsized (80 mm× 90 mm× 0.5 mm) radiating element. In addition, the antenna achieved a maximum realized gain of 0.6 dB and a total efficiency of 67.45% with the nanosatellite structure and a solar panel. The challenges addressed by the proposed antenna are to ensure solar panel placement between the radiating element and the ground plane, and provide approximately 55% open space to allow solar irradiance into the solar panel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-07 22:06:20","2025-11-07 22:06:20","","","","8","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: M.T.

The most prized among miniature antenna choices is the microstrip patch antenna (MPA). These antennas are low cost, lightweight and need for mechanically robust construction as well as ease of installation and aerodynamic profile but have fewer capabilities. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization method has been utilized for performances optimization of a MPA with parasitic elements (MPA-PE) in order to get a desirable multiband antenna for X/Ku bands CubeSat applications. GAs are capable of handling a large number of design parameters and work for optimization problems that have non-differentiable or discontinuous multi-dimensional solution spaces, making them ideal for antenna optimization. As there is not a unique solution, a GA was applied using an objective function based on the return loss at the desired frequencies. Therefore, the optimized antenna has a compact size, its geometry and characteristics are compatible with all standard structures of CubeSats. This antenna is designed and simulated using the electromagnetic simulator ANSYS HFSS, and CST MWS software is used for re-simulation of the designed antenna and the results are in good agreement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-07 22:06:20","2025-11-07 22:06:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

For the analysis process Computer Simulation Software (CST) microwave studio and High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS) have been used and their working procedure is Finite Integration Technique (FIT) as well as Finite Element Method (FEM). The anticipated antenna consists of a truncated corner cut patch with a T-shaped slot in the ground plane. Both CST and HFSS packages of simulation software have been justified to find the axial ratio and reflection coefficient result. The CST and HFSS simulated results show that the obtained impedance bandwidths are 130 MHz (2.30–2.43 GHz) and 140 MHz (2.28–2.43 GHz) respectively, good enough for S-band satellite applications.

Students from five nations (Japan, Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh) collaborated to develop a number of CubeSats with coordinated ground coverage, named 'Joint Global Multi-Nation BIRDS,' or abbreviated as 'BIRDS.' To establish the downlink communication between satellite and Earth, an UHF patch antenna was utilized. Patch antennas offer an ideal solution to Cube satellite communication requirements due to their compact dimension and lightweight. However, the limited surface area available in CubeSats, conventional UHF and VHF patch antennas cannot be used. In this paper, a compact coaxial fed UHF (437.375 MHz) patch antenna system for 1U BIRDS-1 CubeSat (small satellite) is presented. The proposed antenna consists of a spiral meander line patch at the top side and partial ground plane another side of the substrate. A shorting pin has also been utilized to change the resonance to the required UHF band. For the intended 1U BIRDS-1 application, the goal is to mount on satellite body within a limited area of 1U BIRDS-1 satellite. The proposed antenna dimension ( 0.105λ × 0.047λ × 0.002 λ at 437.375 MHz) and characteristics are compatible with any CubeSat standard structure. A prototype of the antenna was developed with a 1.57-mm-thick single layer Roger's substrate having a relative permittivity of 2.2, and measured results are consistent with simulation. The proposed UHF antenna has integrated and tested with 1U BIRDS-1 satellite. Finally, the satellite was successfully launched on June 3, 2017, from the John F.

In this paper this type of antenna is proposed which includes those characteristics. This antenna has a ground which is in a shape of square. On the upper portion, there is a patch which is also a square but two corner of that patch was slotted equally. Connection between patch and ground has been established by a coaxial probe. The patch of this antenna is fed through this probe. Creation of resonance is done by those slots which is created straightway of secondary diagonal of the patch. As this design is too simple so it'll be easier to integrate it on the satellite body. Those slots on the secondary diagonal side which is the modification of the patch, help to achieve resonance in the expecting frequency. Resonance is basically excited by these slots. Experimental and simulated results of proposed design are desirable. In operating band, its axial ratio is less than 3 dB. In 2.40 GHz frequency, the gain of this prototype is 7dBi.

A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized satellite used primarily by university research groups for demonstration of technology. They are low earth orbiting sun-synchronous (LEOSS) type of satellites. The design protocol specifies maximum outer dimensions equal to 100 mm×100 mm×100 mm and weighing a mass between 1.3-6 kg. However, being small in size, they pose some challenges such as low profile antenna, possibility for cross-link communication with other similar satellites and high reliability of communication in a swarm without the prior knowledge of their positions. Additionally CubeSats dictate the space limitation for placing the antenna within it. With all these, it also requires small antenna with high gain and wide directivity. The most suitable antennas that address most of the aforementioned challenges are planar antennas. The design and simulation of the proposed design of electrically small sband antenna for CubeSat achieves gain of 5.01 dBi with a narrow bandwidth of 100 MHz.

The integrated antennas were developed using microstrip-antenna technology, and the antennas were designed to be low profile while having minimal (or zero) blockage of the solar panels on the CubeSat. Two types of designs were investigated: 1) transparent antennas, which are placed above the solar panels (supersolar) and 2) nontransparent antennas, which are placed below the solar panels (subsolar). For past: using transparent metal and using a wire mesh design. The transparent metal indium tin oxide has a comparatively high sheet impedance, which makes an antenna design less efficient. Also, there is a tradeoff between conductivity and transparency [6]. However, a highly conductive thin mesh structure has demonstrated a reasonable efficiency and a high transparency [7]. The substrate must then also be transparent, e.g., glass or quartz. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","59-68","","2","59","","IEEE Antennas Propag Mag","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 60; CODEN: IAPME</p>","","","Antenna design; Antennas; High transparency; Indium tin oxide; Integrated antennas; Low-profile antennas; Mesh generation; Mesh structures; Microstrip antennas; Mission reliability; Sheet metal; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Tin oxides; Transparency; Transparent metals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To extend the application of the present design to an array antenna, a square cavity is introduced. This simple and low-cost approach results in a wide-band printed MSSA with high directivity. To verify this design concept, antenna prototypes operating at Ku frequency band have been designed and fabricated. Simulation and measurement results show that the present designs have more than 16% 10-dB return loss and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth within the same frequency range with high radiation efficiency. The beam-scanning performance of the array antenna using the present design was investigated, and the calculated results suggest that good CP performance is obtained during the beam scanning. The advantages of our MSSA design are wide overlapped bandwidth, low profile, flexibility in antenna performance tuning, and easy fabrication.

However, until recently, there has been very limited development in the area of high gain CubeSat antennas, which are critical for both high data rate communications and radar science. A Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. Because of this, three years ago the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities, with one of the key thrusts being the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 meter, 35 Ghz antenna in a 1.5U canister. This paper discusses the process of taking the antenna from a first prototype to the flight design, how the design successfully met its goals, and lessons learned. A prototype antenna was constructed in early 2015, and then upgraded to an engineering model at the end of 2016. KaPDA will be flying on the RainCube mission, and Earth Science CubeSat. KaPDA is the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat, and the first of its kind to operate at Ka-band enabling a number of opportunities for high rate deep space antenna communications and radar science. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Spacecr.

Complemented by the communications system, these three systems form the core of any nanosatellite mission. Their special importance can also be seen in the amount of mass, volume, and electronic power consumption they account for on CubeSat missions. The more precise the attitude determination and control system of a CubeSat becomes, the less resources are available for payloads on such satellites. To allow for larger payloads a highly integrated CubeSat side panel was developed at Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. This side panel comprises commercial off-the-shelf MEMS sensors for attitude determination and housekeeping, space-graded solar cells, a solar antenna, and two attitude actuators. Dual three-axis rate gyroscopes together with dual three-axis magnetic field sensors and a sun sensor based on a position sensitive device are used for attitude determination. The efficiency of the solar cells is increased by using a maximum power point tracking algorithm that is running on a microcontroller which is located on the side panel. A solar cell was combined with a S band patch antenna to form a so-called solar antenna. The solar antenna allows for high data rate downlink while keeping the loss in effective solar cell area on the side panel at a minimum. Coarse attitude control is realized by an electro-magnetic coil that is integrated inside the printed circuit board of the side panel. For precise and agile attitude control a newly developed fluid-dynamic actuator for picosatellites is mounted on the side panel. The two actuators together with the sensors and the microcontroller allow for local preprocessing of attitude determination and control, thus freeing the on-board computer from these tasks. The design of the printed circuit board makes it possible to produce different variants of the side panel, for example by substituting the solar antenna with a larger solar cell and by removing the fluid-dynamic actuator. Significantly larger payloads are enabled by implementing the highly integrated side panel on CubeSat missions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","6191-6198","","","9","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The science payload on MiRaTA consists of a triband microwave radiometer and global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (GPSRO) sensor. The microwave radiometer takes measurements of all-weather temperature (V-band, 50-57 GHz), water vapor (G-band, 175-191 GHz), and cloud ice (G-band, 205 GHz) to provide observations used to improve weather forecasting. The Aerospace Corporation's GPSRO experiment, called the compact total electron content and atmospheric GPS sensor (CTAGS), measures profiles of temperature and pressure in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (∼20 km) and electron density in the ionosphere (over 100 km). The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPSRO: 1) new ultracompact and low-power technology for multichannel and multiband passive microwave radiometers, 2) the application of a commercial off-the-shelf GPS receiver and custom patch antenna array technology to obtain neutral atmospheric GPSRO retrieval from a nanosatellite, and 3) a new approach to space-borne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements. In this paper, we focus on objective 3, developing operational models to meet a mission goal of 100 concurrent radiometer and GPSRO measurements, and estimating the temperature measurement precision for the CTAGS instrument based on thermal noise Based on an analysis of thermal noise of the CTAGS instrument, the expected temperature retrieval precision is between 0.17 and 1.4 K, which supports the improvement of radiometric calibration to 0.25 K. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","5703-5714","","12","9","","IEEE J.

The main problem of common Microstrip patch antennas is that they only operate at one or two frequencies, restricting the number of bands that equipment is capable of supporting. Another issue is that, due to the very strict space that a solar panel has, setting up more antenna array is very difficult. To reduce these problems, the use of fractal shaped antennas integrated on solar cells will be analyzed. The small satellite applications demand a high efficient multi-band antenna with a very compact size. A 2x2 Sierpinski Fractal antenna array is modeled and simulated using HFSS.

Two right-angled non-overlapping slots are used on each antenna to enable the two different polarization states. The antenna array has 14 GHz patches on the top substrate layer and 35 GHz patches on the lower substrate layer in order to maintain a similar percentage bandwidth. The microstrip feed lines are located at the bottom of the feed substrate. A symmetric feed structure is followed for the antenna array. The aperture coupling feeding network has the advantage of reduced spurious radiation compared to edge or probe feeds as it utilized highly linearly polarized feed lines and slots, and a large ground plane to prevent backside radiation. The designed antenna array has linear polarization at 45-degrees and 135-degrees at the Ku- and Ka-frequency bands. The array is designed using a hybrid simulation scheme in Keysight Advance Design System (ADS). The ADS Schematic is used for the feed network while the ADS Momentum is used for the antenna elements and the entire array structure simulations. In this way, all aspects of the design (microstrip antenna elements and feed lines) can be optimized independently. This array is suitable for airborne (small remotely piloted), and small-satellite NASA flight programs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","","","","2016-June","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Aerosp.

To compensate, a Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. Unfortunately, high gain antenna developments to this point have only focused on S-band, which does not provide the required gain. Two years ago, JPL initiated a research and technology development effort to design a half-meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (15 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) and provide 42dB of gain (or 50% efficiency). The process of designing, building, and testing of KaPDA is discussed in this paper. The design uses folding ribs to fit in the stowage space, deep rib sections with precision hinges to maintain surface accuracy, and a combination of an innovative gas and spring system to deploy the antenna. The constructed antenna was demonstrated to achieve a gain of 42.5 dB before deployment, and a gain of 42 dB after deployment. KaPDA would create opportunities for a host of new CubeSat missions from enabling high rate deep space communications to radar science. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-07 22:06:21","2025-11-07 22:06:21","","","","","0","","","","","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIAA Aerosp.

The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPS radio occultation: (1) new ultra-compact and low-power technology for multi-channel and multi-band passive microwave radiometers, (2) new GPS receiver and patch antenna array technology for both neutral atmosphere and ionospheric GPS radio occultation retrieval on a nanosatellite, and (3) a new approach to spaceborne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","5304-5307","","","2015-November","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 15; Conference name: IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2015; Conference location: Milan; Conference sponsors: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (IEEE GRSS); CODEN: IGRSE</p>","","","atmospheric measurement; Global Positioning System; low Earth orbit satellites; Passive microwave remote sensing; radiometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, such a design does not exist as current CubeSat high gain antennas have focused on S-band. JPL has initiated a research and technology development effort to design a half-meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (10 cm × 10 cm × 15 cm) and provide 42dB of gain (50% efficiency). The KaPDA design must solve conflicting mechanical requirements on surface accuracy, stowed space, and ability to deploy. The development of a conceptual design that satisfies each requirement is discussed in this paper. The design uses folding ribs to fit in the stowage space, deep rib sections with precision hinges to maintain surface accuracy, and a combination of an innovative inflating bladder and springs to deploy the antenna. RF simulations show that after losses, KaPDA would have about 42 dB gain, at 50% efficiency. KaPDA would create opportunities for a host of new CubeSat missions by allowing high data rate communication which would enable using data intensive instruments or venturing further into deep space, including interplanetary missions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc. custserv@aiaa.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2nd AIAA Spacecraft Struct.

Due for launch in 2017, for the present, OPS-SAT will fly at a maximal altitude of 620 km in a Sun-synchronous orbit. Experimenters will have the opportunity to upload and test new control software as well as reconfigure hardware during the mission. OPS-SAT uses a triple unit CubeSat (30 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) with deployable solar panels as a platform. For communication, an S-band and an X-band payload will be included besides the backup UHF. The CCSDS-compatible S-band communication link will act as the main link for data communication and will provide uplink speeds of up to 256 kbit/s and downlink speeds of up to 1 Mbit/s. An X-band payload for downlink only will provide high-data-rate communications of up to 50 Mbit/s. This paper reports on the design and the prototype development of the S-band and X-band communication antennas. As the final S-band and X-band frequencies are still to be defined, prototypes have been developed with nominal resonance frequencies of 2.2 GHz and 8.1 GHz, respectively. The antennas have been designed as metal patches with right hand circular polarization. The single X-band patch antenna is mounted on the 10 cm × 10 cm nadir looking face of the triple unit CubeSat. A pair of S-band patch antennas is mounted on opposite sides of the cuboid, facing the astronomical horizon. The design of the antennas as well as their position on the satellite structure have been simulated and enhanced with a 3D electromagnetic simulation software. The results have been verified by placing the antenna prototypes on a full size satellite mock-up and measuring the far field pattern in an anechoic chamber. The study reports on the communication capabilities of the antennas in the light of constraints and requirements of CubeSat missions. The study further describes the manufacturing process of the prototype antennas. It could be shown that the current approach is suitable for operating the mission. The S-band downlink can be closed in 94% of the cases - yet 95% for the uplink. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","3555-3561","","","5","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

It was launched on 8 July 2014, and operations have been conducted since then using the Ground Station at Chilbolton Observatory, and a custom-built Ground Segment. It uses UHF for uplink and VHF for downlink. The CubeSat is a technology demonstrator and the needs of the six payloads are very different, with two communications payloads (a demonstrator S-band radio and patch antenna, and FL'Ncube-2), two with novel hardware from industrial groups and two with hardware for scientific applications from university groups. The Ground Segment allows the needs of the different payloads to be addressed, commanding to be pre-planned and tested using a software simulator, and some processing (and checking) of the data and housekeeping is performed before the data is distributed to the payload providers. The flexibility provided by the custom-built Ground Segment proved invaluable, since its modular design meant that an alternative method of communicating with the satellite could be inserted into the system when the original end-To-end system was found to have issues, and as new methods of operation were designed they could be included in the command uplink and downlink chain. It was also possible to uplink new procedures onto the CubeSat providing payloads with alternative methods of operation. These showed that the approach adopted here could be extended to future CubeSats without affecting platform and payload selection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","4380-4383","","","6","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The satellite will carry five GNSS patch antennas, each connected to two independent u-blox multi-GNSS receivers. These very small, commercially available low-cost receivers are able to track single-frequency code and phase data of all the major GNSS, i.e. GPS, GLONASS, QZSS, Beidou (and ready for Galileo). Four main science objectives have been defined for the CubETH mission: (1) precise orbit determination using low-cost GNSS receivers, (2) attitude determination based on very short baselines, (3) comparison of the performance in space between GPS and GLONASS (and possibly other GNSS) as an important step for farther developments of space-bome GNSS receivers, (4) additional experimental measurements (e.g. for air density estimation during re-entry). The satellite will carry 3 retro-reflectors to enable satellite laser ranging for performance validation of the precise orbit determination. Novel CubeSat technologies will also be tested. We will take into account lessons learned from the SwissCube mission, which is in operation since 2009. A new modular design for the structure as well as connectors will be flown. We also intend to demonstrate the use of a miniaturized low-power command and data handling system, which shall control the satellite. In this paper, we will present the reasons for new technologies, based on our experience with SwissCube. In this paper, we will discuss the current status of the main concepts for the CubETH spacecraft and its payload. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","4456-4466","","","6","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Arrays composed of linearly and circularly polarized microstrip antennas are investigated. The performance of such arrays is assessed including parameter variations, especially for the case of dielectric constant of the antenna substrate and misalignment in the orientation of the array elements.

Such integration resolves two main issues for a Cube Satellite (CubeSat): (1) saving surface real estate, and (2) reduce the deployment that is needed for the traditional wire antennas. By examining the solar panel assembly, it is straightforward to see that there are mainly two possible methods for antenna integration: (1) antenna under the solar cells, (2) around solar cells, and (3) on top of solar cells. For the first two types of integration, where the antenna geometry can be either slot type or microstrip patch, there have been studies performed to assess the relation between the antennas and solar cells. For the antennas on top of solar cells, although such a design can be very versatile when the antenna is designed transparent to light, there has not yet accurate assessment on the relation of the two devices. This paper is aimed to provide such an assessment using experimental methods. The data collected from this experimental study can then be used to provide better model for future simulative studies in antenna-solar cell integration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2014","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: United States Nat.

Amateur Radio Satellites were launched since 1961, currently more over 70 amateur radio satellites have been launched. In addition, several university satellites, Cubesats and Nanosats are also frequently using amateur radio frequencies. Lots of them are operational, offering voice and digital communication capabilities. ARISS (Amateur Radio on ISS) is a world-wide volunteer network using amateur radio frequencies to enable contacts between schools and astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, ARISS develops hardware, manages and organizes its use for educational purposes on ISS. A new experiment is recently installed within the ISS COLUMBUS module, called ""HAM Video"". Two Patch Antennas on the nadir side of the COLUMBUS module are used to transmit cabin video using standard DVB-S type signals on S-Band towards the earth. These transmissions will extend the current radio-based bi-directional ARISS school ""HAM Radio"" contacts to a new ""HAM TV"" service by providing a video signal downlink in parallel to amateur radio voice transmissions. This paper will describe the possibilities to use the International Space Station and its various amateur radio equipment and transmissions for educational purposes. Starting from prediction of satellite passes to building own reception equipment like antennas and radios to reception and decoding of the signals and measurements using these received signals offers various possibilities for school groups and interested individuals to participate. Technology demonstrators like Ham Video transmissions using DVB-S standard in S-Band offers modern possibilities for interested pupils to design and optimize their receiving station. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2014","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","8231-8234","","","11","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, moving from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or further, the communication systems currently implemented will not be able to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks is the antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Current antennas for CubeSats are mostly dipole or patch antennas with limited gain. Deployable (not inflatable) antennas for CubeSats are currently being investigated, but these solutions are affected by the challenge of packaging the whole deployable structure in a small spacecraft. The work that we propose represents the first attempt to develop an inflatable antenna for CubeSats. Inflatable structures and antennas can be packaged efficiently, occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. Inflatable antennas have been previously tested in space (Inflatable Antenna Experiment, STS-77). However they have never been developed for small spacecraft such as CubeSats, where the packaging efficiency, the deployment, and the inflation represent a challenge. The article covers the design and radiation model for the antenna. Details of the antenna's fabrication and related issues are illustrated as well as the mechanism to fold and deploy the antenna in space. The results of the experimental tests are described. The extension of simulation to cover the X-Band is also discussed. Future work in the development of the antenna will include the improvement of the fabrication process and the design of a 3U CubeSat mission to be proposed as a technical demonstration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2014","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Society of Allied Weight Engineers","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Annu.

This limits the power available for radio communications, which constrains the downlink budget. The limited transmit power translates to low downlink data rates on small satellites. Antenna gain from directive antennas may be a power efficient way of improving the downlink budget, thereby increasing the downlink rate of small satellites. We have developed a prototype low-power, electrically-steered S-band phased array RF front-end suitable for a CubeSat that could efficiently increase the EIRP, permitting higher data rates. A prototype of the array has been constructed and tested in an anechoic chamber. The four element array provides a minimum gain of 2.5 dB and average gain of 5 dB compared to a single patch antenna element with a 5Wpower envelope across a range of up to 60 degrees from broadside of the array. Given the 100 mW overhead of each phased array element, the design is expected to scale to a 16 element array, which could fit on two 20 cm by 10 cm deployable panels on a 2U CubeSat. With a 10 watt average power budget for the transmitter, such an array would provide an estimated gain of 11 dB compared to a single omnidirectional antenna. © 2014 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2014","2025-11-07 22:06:22","2025-11-07 22:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Aerosp.

The promising results achieved have led to the decision to develop a transmitter for ESA PROBA-V spacecraft to be launched in 2013. The first flight models have been designed in only 18 months and will be delivered to ESA in February 2012. In the same way, CNES is now studying a solution to download telemetry in X band for cube and nano satellites. The aim is to provide a high data rate subsystem for missions with high telemetry needs such as Space Spectrum Survey, Automatic Identification System by satellite, Earth Observation, etc.... The paper first demonstrates the capacity of this solution to download several gigabytes per day. Link budgets with 3 and 5 m diameter antenna ground stations are presented for data rates up to 50 Mbps in different operating modes. Then a description of the miniaturized transmitter in development is done. It is designed to cope with the restricted space and energy of very small platforms. The footprint and volume are specially designed to fit with CubeSat or NanoSat dimensions and the DC/DC consumption is limited to only 10W for 33 dBm RF output power. Critical functions such as flexible bit rate section, data interface, high efficiency power amplifier are described and the performances of the first prototype are presented. The last part is dedicated to the antenna. The design is based on a simple patch antenna realized on standard substrate. The performances of a prototype have been measured in CNES antenna facilities and are in conformance with the simulations.

One of the antennas is mounted on the satellite's zenith panel and receives signals primarily used for precise orbit determination (POD) experiments. The second antenna is pointed towards the anti-flight direction of the satellite for collecting measurements of low elevation satellites for ionospheric and tropospheric occultations.

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, moving from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or further, the communication systems currently implemented will not be able to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks in small spacecraft communication systems is represented by antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Current antennas for CubeSats are mostly dipole or patch antennas with limited gain. Deployable (not inflatable) antennas for CubeSats are currently being investigated, but these solutions are affected by the challenge of packaging the whole deployable structure in a small spacecraft. The work that we propose represents the first attempt to develop an inflatable antenna for CubeSats. Inflatable structures and antennas can be packaged efficiently occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. Inflatable antennas have been previously tested in space (Inflatable Antenna Experiment, STS-77). However they have never been developed for small spacecraft such as CubeSats, where the packaging efficiency, the deployment, and the inflation represent a challenge. Our study explores for the first time the possibility of developing such antenna in a way compatible with CubeSat dimensions and constraints. The research provides answers on the possible dimensions for an inflatable antenna for small satellites, on the gain and resolution that can be achieved, and on the deployment and inflation mechanism compatible with CubeSat. Future work in the development of the antenna will include the test of the antenna in flight during a specific technical demonstration mission.

However, the low mass also restricts the functionality of a nano-satellite's payload. Typically, this would imply instruments with very low to low resolution and accuracy, essentially ruling out applications such as remote sensing. However, multiple nano-satellites can cooperate to improve the overall system performance, for example by increasing the frequency of the observations. The objective of this study is to design a radar system that can be accommodated in a nano-satellite, and investigate the feasibility of using multiples of these nano-satellites to perform high temporal resolution remote sensing. In this paper therefore, the concept of a nano-satellite sized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nano-SAR) is investigated. Nano-satellites have very constrained power and volume budgets, and there are limits to how much surface area they can unfold for use in radar. Given these constraints, a SAR system for use in a nano-satellite in a 350 km orbit was sized, and approaches to tackle the deficits in the radar link budget are proposed. When applying state-of-the-art technologies, both on the component level, as well as on an architectural level, one arrives at a closed link budget. The proposed radar system consists of a patch antenna array with a span of 1.14 m by 0.18 m, operating at a frequency of 5.8 GHz. Power amplification and phase shifting is performed on the panel, using digital radio frequency (RF) integrated Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. This results in a swath width of 60 km, with pixel sizes of 10 m in elevation direction. Given these performance values, coupled with the increased revisit times, it was obvious this radar, when flown in a larger swarm of nano-satellites, would allow faster now-casting for weather prediction. With significant investment in technology development, it could be possible to use this system for SAR interferometry, for near-real-time monitoring of fast ground deformation phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes. Other applications could lie in the field of near-real-time ship motion detection and oil spill spread detection. Many technical challenges need to be solved still and platforms need to be designed, capable of supporting this system, before this payload would be ready for deployment. Preliminary design suggests the cost of such an instrument is substantially higher than what is common for nano-satellite components. However, the potential of such a system is extremely promising, and merits further investigation.©2012 by the International Astronautical Federation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2012","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","8159-8164","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Flight demonstration onboard a small satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is now under consideration. When a high power microwave is irradiated from antenna in LEO plasma environment, there is a concern about discharge caused by interaction between the plasma and the microwave. There has been no experimental observation on such interaction phenomenon. Verification experiment is essential for SSPS to become a reality. We have set-up an experimental system that can simulate the radiation of high power microwave under dense plasma in a vacuum chamber. A RF plasma source was installed to the chamber that we filled with Argon plasma environment of density from 1011 to 10 m' with 4eV to 6eV temperature under a back pressure of 2.6x10"" Pa. A patch antenna made of Glass epoxy substrate was installed inside the chamber. The antenna was connected to a magnetron that could produce 5.8GHz microwave. We monitored the antenna surface temperature, the radiated and reflected power, the chamber pressure and others while we injected the microwave to the antenna up to 45W. We examined whether discharge or related phenomena occur or not on the patch antennas for various conditions to verify the hypothesis of discharge inception that discharge is caused by multi-pactoring and breakdown of the outgas product.

By fabricating a switchable single feed circular patch antenna over a properly designed electronically tuneable high impedance ground plane, its radiation pattern can be steered. The feeding network in this design is also simplified. To demonstrate the concept, an antenna prototype with right hand circular polarisation (RHCP) at C band is developed, simulated and described in this paper. Using the electronically tuneable approach on both the antenna feed and high impedance ground plane the proposed antenna is able to cover 360° in azimuth at an elevation angle of 45° with an axial ratio lower than 3 dB. Furthermore, it reports a gain of 7.9 dBi at 4.8 GHz. The antenna is shown to be capable of achieving the beam-switching by tuning the high impedance surface electronically. The beam-switching is achieved without the use of array antenna, microwave phase shifters or beam-switching feed networks such as the Butler Matrix. Hence the proposed beam-switching CP antenna has compact size and low-cost, and is promising for small satellites applications. © 2012 IEEE. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2012","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: LAPC - Loughborough Antennas Propag.

In small satellites however, this subsystem is often overlooked, either due to consideration of weight or available space. Using traditional design approach is not feasible and does not offer any significant benefits. With increasing availability of ""Commercial Off the Shelf"" (COTS) components in S and higher bands it is now possible to design Antenna and RF subsystem which comply with given requirements. Space is a vast unexplored territory and it is important not to lose track and control of a satellite. As payloads become more demanding in terms of bandwidth requirements it is desirable to have a high data rate communication link. This calls for use of more directive and narrower beamwidth antennas with sufficient bandwidth. On the contrary, for the purpose of tracking and identification it is preferred to have a less directive and wider beamwidth antennas. Therefore, such an antenna subsystem is required that can address solution for this problem. Such provision is made in the antenna design of ""AraMis"" (Italian acronym for Modular Architecture for Satellites) nanosatellites project which is a modular based architecture. The aim is to design a non-mission specific antenna which provides dynamic reconfigurable solution, making it flexible from application stand point. Thus, allowing the reuse of same design architecture for even future missions needs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2012","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE AESS Eur.

The technical objective of the mission is achieving 1 km/s of delta-V over a 1 year mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This will be accomplished using a novel electric propulsion system, the Diverging Cusped Field Thruster (DCFT), which enables high efficiency orbital changes of the ESPA-ring class satellite. CASTOR is capable of improving rapid access to space capabilities by providing an orbital transfer platform with a very high performance to mass ratio, thus greatly reducing launch costs and allowing for highly efficient orbital manoeuvre. Furthermore, CASTOR is highly scalable and modular, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of scales and applications. CASTOR is developed as part of the University Nanosatellite Program (UNP) funded by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). In order to accomplish CASTOR mission objective, a highly optimized, scalable, light weight, and low cost communication system needed to be developed. These constraints imply the development of trade studies to select the final communication system architecture able to maximize the amount of data transmitted, while guaranteeing reliability, redundancy and limited mass, power consumption, and cost. A special attention is also required to guarantee a reliable communication system in cases of tumbling, or in case of strong Doppler shift which is inevitable due to the high delta-V capabilities of the vehicle. In order to accomplish all the mission requirements, different features have been introduced in the design of the communication system for this mission. Specifically, customized patch antennas have been realized, and a customized communication protocol has been designed and implemented. The communication subsystem has been validated through an intense testing campaign which included software tests in the laboratory, hardware tests in anechoic chamber, and in flight tests through a balloon experiment. The article presents an overview of CASTOR mission, a presentation of the trade studies analysis and of the final communication architecture selected, a description of the customized antenna developed, of the customized protocol designed, and a presentation of the results of the tests performed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

And it is known that during both the period of attitude adjustment after the separation and working time of a satellite, TTC (Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) are very important functions necessary for the proper operation of it. In this paper, firstly a design process of a dual-band patch antenna, which can operate at 2GHz and 2.2 GHz for TTC applications on small satellites is presented, followed by the approach of the placement optimization of the TTC patch antenna onboard for a mini-satellite. In order to obtain one better strategy, the construction of the antenna is discussed and two schemes of antennas placement are introduced. Through the results secured by electromagnetic computation, it is indicated that situating three patch antennas respectively on three adjacent walls and the forth one on the cut-off bottom corner can provide a satisfactory omni-directional radiation pattern. To reduce the complexity, a new method to conform a patch antenna on the mini-satellite is proposed by bending the antenna along one edge of the cube in a top corner. By comparison and analysis, it is concluded that one bended patch antenna can perform as well as four ordinary ones do so that it can effectively cut off the weight and volume of the spacecraft, and facilitate the feeding intricacy. All the S-parameter and radiation pattern results used for analysis were calculated with the CEM software CST Microwave Studio, which is based on the finite integral technique (FIT). © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2011","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","1110-1114","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Prog.

Multiband and wideband antennas are desirable in personal communication systems, small satellite communication terminals and other wireless applications. This study presents bow-tie printed antenna design and simulation based on dipole antenna concepts and its simulation using Method of Moments (MoM). The wideband response is obtained for this structure. Then MATLAB® is used to implement fractal shapes on the basic configuration. This antenna as a wideband solution is used in monolithic wireless communication applications that require multi-resonance frequencies. These features can be improved by fractalizing the antenna. While the bandwidth of the antenna can be changed by different flare angles, its fractalizing controls the multiband feature without any significant change on the radiation pattern. Numerical results of the antenna radiation characteristics, including input impedance, input reflection coefficient and radiation pattern, are presented and compared for mode-2 Sierpinski fractal shapes which is implemented on the basic bow-tie antenna. © 2011 Academic Journals Inc. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2011","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","35-43","","1","3","","Res.

CubeSats are used for space research, but their low-rate communication capability limits functionality. As greater payload and instrumentation functions are sought, increased data rate is needed. Since most CubeSats currently transmit at a 437 MHz frequency, several directional antenna types were studied for a 2.45 GHz, larger bandwidth transmission. This higher frequency provides the bandwidth needed for increasing the data rate. A deployable antenna mechanism maybe needed because most directional antennas are bigger than the CubeSat size constraints. From the study, a deployable hemispherical helical antenna prototype was built. Transmission between two prototype antenna equipped transceivers at varying distances tested the helical performance. When comparing the prototype antenna's maximum transmission distance to the other commercial antennas, the prototype outperformed all commercial antennas, except the patch antenna. The root cause was due to the helical antenna's narrow beam width. Future work can be done in attaining a more accurate alignment with the satellite's directional antenna to downlink with a terrestrial ground station. ©2010 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2010","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","347-352","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 36; Correspondence Address: P.

Their contributions for space research, extended global communications and surveillance have been instrumental for the advancement of the information age. As part of the effort to create this outer space network, small satellites that in average weigh less than 5 Kg are becoming important players in space communications. Limitations of surface area on small satellites leave barely enough room for solar cells, which are necessary to power the internal systems of the satellite. This repeatedly impedes the placement of external elements such as antennas. Without the required surface area for topical microstrip patches, complex and failure prone antennas, such as deployable parabolic reflectors, are often used. This adds substantially to cost and labor hours as well as the potential for failure. Transparent and conductive materials such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) have been used in the developed of topical patch antennas [1], [2] that could potentially be mounted on top of solar cells. ITO has a high optical transparency (90%-80%) at very thin depositions (100nm-1.2um) while maintaining a considerably high conductivity of 281319 S/m. However, at very thin depositions efficiency of patch antennas is severely handicapped by skin and ground effects. This paper presents a revised expression for surface resistivity that better accounts for these effects at both low frequencies (100MHz) and high frequencies (10 GHz). Furthermore, this paper addresses the challenges involved with patch antennas made from transparent materials for integration with solar cells. © 2010 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2010","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

The antenna is realized stacking two coaxial shorted annular patches and placing the top one at half a wavelength from the lower one. At variance of other similar configurations proposed in the past, the one presented in this paper has several important features which can be extremely useful for application in the space environment. In particular, it can be easily fabricated employing suspended technology and its radiation characteristics are to some extent controllable by opportunely varying the geometry. In the following, a straightforward design procedure will be presented detailing the criteria to optimize top and bottom radiating elements. Both numerical and measured results will show that the proposed design satisfies the specifications and presents characteristics comparable to other larger and heavier solutions usually more difficult to design. Specifically, it will be shown that with this configuration it is possible to obtain gain values higher than 12 dB using ground plane of moderate size and that a further improvement up to 15dB can be obtained employing larger ground planes. © 2007 IEEE. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2007","2025-11-07 22:06:23","2025-11-07 22:06:23","","277-282","","2","55","","IEEE Trans Antennas Propag","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 07 November 2025; Cited By: 114; CODEN: IETPA</p>","","","Antenna radiation; Circular polarization; Computational geometry; High gain microstrip antenna; Microstrip antennas; Radiating elements; Small satellite missions; Specifications; Stacked parasitic element","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design rationale is based on the features of the Shorted Annular Patch (SAP) [ref. 1] antennas. These radiators have been studied for their radiation pattern flexibility features. The gain increase combined with the possibility to control the beam aperture can result highly beneficial in designing directive antennas of small and medium satellites. In addition to the radiation properties, SAP antennas have mechanical features well suited for application in space environment. In fact, shorted rings can be easily adapted to solutions employing suspended technology and high performance materials. This opportunity eliminates the problems arising from the sensitivity of the electrical characteristics of the substrates and the distortion generated by the diffraction of surface waves seems to be advisable. This configuration is easily accomplished as the central short provides a supporting element on which single or stacked SAPs can be build. The design is based on a SAP radiator integrated with a stacked parasitic element. With this solution the beam aperture can be shaped by opportunely selecting the antenna outer radius while the parasitic patch is used to further increase the antenna gain. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2004","2025-11-07 22:06:24","2025-11-07 22:06:24","","5510-5512","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

During our participation, an amateur rocket was used to launch a single small satellite that we constructed called CanSat and that we used for two experiments. The first involved the use of a flexible GPS patch antenna attached to the parachute and the second involved attitude determination using solar cells.
