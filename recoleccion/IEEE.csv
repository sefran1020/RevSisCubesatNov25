Chin","A Survey and Study of Planar Antennas for Pico-Satellites","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2506577","","Works on pico-satellites have gained momentum recently, especially those that consider pico-satellites as part of a much larger constellation or swarm. This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size (34 × 13 mm2) and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide -10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of -15.2 dB.","2015","2025-11-07 22:11:29","2025-11-07 22:11:29","","2590-2612","","","3","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","antenna arrays; beam steering; circular polarization; Circular polarization; CubeSat; Gain; Microstrip; Microstrip antennas; microstrip patch antennas; Patch antennas; Photonic Band- Gap (PBG); photonic band-gap (PBG); pico-satellites; planar antennas; Planar arrays; reconfigurable antennas; Satellites; sequential phase-rotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cho","BIRDS-1 CubeSat Constellation Using Compact UHF Patch Antenna","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871209","","BIRDS-1 satellites, a constellation of five identical 1U CubeSats, were designed, manufactured, assembled, integrated, and tested at LASINE Laboratory, Kyutech, Japan. Students from five nations (Japan, Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh) collaborated to develop a number of CubeSats with coordinated ground coverage, named “Joint Global Multi-Nation BIRDS,”or abbreviated as “BIRDS.”To establish the downlink communication between satellite and Earth, an UHF patch antenna was utilized. Patch antennas offer an ideal solution to Cube satellite communication requirements due to their compact dimension and lightweight. However, the limited surface area available in CubeSats, conventional UHF and VHF patch antennas cannot be used. In this paper, a compact coaxial fed UHF (437.375 MHz) patch antenna system for 1U BIRDS-1 CubeSat (small satellite) is presented. The proposed antenna consists of a spiral meander line patch at the top side and partial ground plane another side of the substrate. A shorting pin has also been utilized to change the resonance to the required UHF band. For the intended 1U BIRDS-1 application, the goal is to mount on satellite body within a limited area of 1U BIRDS-1 satellite. The proposed antenna dimension (0.105λ×0.047λ×0.002λ at 437.375 MHz) and characteristics are compatible with any CubeSat standard structure. A prototype of the antenna was developed with a 1.57-mm-thick single layer Roger's substrate having a relative permittivity of 2.2, and measured results are consistent with simulation. The proposed UHF antenna has integrated and tested with 1U BIRDS-1 satellite. Finally, the satellite was successfully launched on June 3, 2017, from the John F. Kennedy Space Center, the USA at Low Earth Orbit for earth observations, message relay, space environment, and technology demonstration through the International Space Station.","2018","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","54282-54294","","","6","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","a small satellite; BIRDS; compact planar antenna; CubeSat; Patch antennas; Satellite antennas; Space vehicles; UHF; UHF antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective is to produce a four-patch antenna array to be mounted on CubeSat deployable wings along with a layer of solar panels, maximizing the usable space and obtaining a better link budget for a standardized Cubesat of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm. The orthogonal feedlines' isolation between Tx/Rx signals and a minimization of the multi-layer design provide a lower profile approach considering the state-of-the-art. The significant thickness reduction combined with a new perspective of having both deployable wings transmitting and receiving signals lead to a notable improvement of the overall system. This work is relevant due to the demand for high-performance antenna systems that may expand the capabilities of CubeSats, considering the importance of using an antenna array instead of a single element approach.","2020","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","20473-20479","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antenna array; Apertures; circular polarization; Couplings; CubeSat; CubeSats; Microstrip antenna arrays; Patch antennas; small satellites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Basutli","Multiband Reconfigurable Antennas for 5G Wireless and CubeSat Applications: A Review","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3166223","","The rapid development of wireless technology has sparked interest in multi-band reconfigurable antennas as devices and satellites are innovating toward miniaturization. With limited space, reliable and efficient high bandwidth antenna systems are needed for current and next-generation wireless technology as well as for the revolutionary small satellites. The fifth generation of mobile communication technology promises high data rates, low latency and good spectrum efficiency. One of the key enablers of this technology is the integration of satellite technology-particularly CubeSats with terrestrial communication technologies. Next-generation antennas that can meet functional requirements for 5G and CubeSat applications are therefore of fundamental importance. These antenna systems should have large bandwidth, high gain and efficiency and be compact in size. Reconfigurable antennas can provide different configurations in terms of the operating frequency, radiation pattern and polarization. Tuning reconfigurable antennas can be done by changing the physical parameters of the antenna elements through electronic switches, optical switches and the use of meta-materials. The most popular implementation method for reconfigurable antennas for wireless and satellite communication is the electronic switching method due to its high reliability, efficiency, and ease of integration with microwave circuitry. In this article, different techniques for implementing reconfigurable and multi-band antennas are reviewed, with emphasis on two main application areas; 5G wireless communication and CubeSat application. Different reconfiguration techniques have been studied for application in various wireless communication systems such as satellite communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, cognitive radio and 5G communication. It has been found that reconfigurable antennas have favourable properties for next-generation wireless technology and small satellites. These properties include low cost, less volume requirements and good isolation between wireless standards.","2022","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","40910-40931","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5G; 5G mobile communication; circular polarization; CubeSat; frequency reconfigurable; Microstrip; Microstrip antenna; Microstrip antennas; multi-band; nanosatellite; radiation pattern; reconfigurable antenna; reflection coefficient; RF-switches; Satellite antennas; Satellite broadcasting; Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal is to eliminate a maximum number of antenna elements with minor gain loss and hence reduce the array size, weight, cost, and power requirements. Consequently, the space saved by the thinned array configuration presents opportunities to integrate additional antennas and hardware, allowing for a low-profile antenna-in-package. Our study showed that a 64% array reduction (from 25 to 9 probe-fed patch antennas) achieved an array gain comparable to a full array configuration. As such, various 9-element configurations for testing were generated through the thinning process and optimized using the genetic algorithm. These configurations were then validated using full-wave simulations. Results show that all configurations that preserved the effective area while maintaining symmetry along all axes showed a minimal effect on gain reduction. Specifically, the best thinning configuration resulted in a loss of only 1.82 dB in simulation at broadside compared to a fully populated  $5\times5$  array. The exact configuration also showed beam scanning performance from −45° to +45° (viz. 90°). A prototype was fabricated and tested for each of the thinned configurations. The measured gain of the optimal 9-element thinned array configuration showed excellent agreement with the simulations.","2023","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","1176-1186","","","4","","IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antenna arrays; Antenna measurements; Antenna theory; array optimization; Arrays; Gain; Genetic algorithms; patch antenna array; Patch antennas; sparse arrays; Thinned arrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bandwidth enhancement was achieved by applying a stacking technique to two square meshed patches with close resonance frequencies. The first antenna used fused silica glass substrates for both lower and upper dielectric layers to maintain transparency and high integrability with the solar cells. The antenna resonated at 2.43 GHz and exhibited an impedance bandwidth of 6.2% and a peak gain of 6.5 dBi. In the second design, a polymer layer replaced the upper glass substrate and was partially removed to reduce the antenna mass. 65% mass reduction was achieved at the expense of lower efficiency. To further reduce the mass, the polymer layer was perforated. The perforated design resulted in a lightweight stacked meshed patch antenna with a normal transparency of 94%, which can be placed directly on top of the solar cells without affecting the cell performance.","2025-08","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","1237-1247","","4","6","","IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antenna measurements; Antennas; Bandwidth; Bandwidth enhancement; Copper; CubeSat; CubeSats; Glass; meshed patch antennas; Microstrip antennas; Patch antennas; Photovoltaic cells; solar cell integrated antennas; stacked antennas; SU-8 photoresist; Substrates; transparent antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plastic CubeSats are appealing candidates. To enable the use of this new generation of space systems, the challenge of designing suitable communication sub-systems must be faced. In this work, a 3Dprinted ABS antenna easily embeddable in a plastic CubeSat is proposed. The 3D-printed material has been characterized in terms of dielectric, mechanical and thermal properties, and the compliance with space requirements has been assessed. In particular, thermogravimetric and calorimetric tests have been carried out. Static and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed. To comply with the stringent weight and space requirements, the unique antenna design of a curved stacked patch has been proposed. The patch covers the uplink (2.025–2.11 GHz) and downlink (2.2–2.29 GHz) bands for Telemetry Tracking and Command (TT&C) applications, with an overall bandwidth of about 300 MHz (14%). Additionally, taking advantage of the curved shape, the proposed antenna shows a size reduction of the resonant length of about 34%. The size of the antenna is  $71.5 \times 71.5 \times 13$  mm3 and is characterized by a weight of only 51 g. Also, in silico tests, by relying on the measured physical properties and a non-linear numerical model, have been carried out to assess the performances of the final antenna layout during a typical CubeSat mission. The proposed design strategy could be used to develop plastic CubeSats embedding performing antennas.","2022","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","1351-1363","","","3","","IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3D printing; ABS; antennas; Antennas; CubeSat; CubeSats; new space economy; Patch antennas; Plastics; Substrates; Three-dimensional displays; Three-dimensional printing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A wideband CP patch array antenna was designed by combining a C-shaped slot-coupled solar cell patch in conjunction with a novel feeding network. The overall size of the proposed CP CubeSat antenna is 100  $\times 100\times7.2$  mm3 ( $0.83\,\,\lambda _{\mathrm {o}} \times 0.83\,\,\lambda _{\mathrm {o}} \times 0.06\,\,\lambda _{\mathrm {o}}$  at 2.5 GHz). Solar cells occupy 79% of the antenna area, enabling efficient energy harvesting. The −10 dB impedance bandwidth is 1.98–3.0 GHz, which is a fractional bandwidth of approximately 41.0%. The 3-dB AR and 3-dB gain bandwidths are 1.98–3.0 GHz (41.0%) and 1.82–2.98 GHz (46.6%), respectively.

The structure has been designed to ensure optimal antenna performance at S-band as well as to minimize any shadowing effects that can reduce the received power at the solar cells. To generate CP, the antenna is driven by two orthogonal feed points, penetrating through a transparent borosilicate glass layer, as well as a silicon and PCB substrate. Simulated and measured performances, on both a preliminary FR4 design and a fully integrated prototype, demonstrate a good impedance bandwidth, satisfactorily axial ratio, as well as stable radiation patterns and minimum shadowing levels. The proposed antenna can be useful for communications between satellites as well as with the ground station, and since the structure is compact and completely integrated, the design can be an alternative approach to new-phased arrays on solar panels and other beam-steering systems.","2019","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","96560-96566","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","circular polarization; CubeSat; Feeds; meshed patch; Patch antennas; Photovoltaic cells; Planar antennas; Solar panels; Substrates; transparent antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this framework, the use of Ka-band for communication is explored. We present the design of a stacked patch antenna working across the down- and uplink Ka-bands. Materials and geometry of the radiator have been selected by accounting for the trade-off between electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical requirements. The design of the antenna is performed with a particle swarm optimization algorithm developed to control the bandwidth and matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. Furthermore, a multiphysics thermal analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized array, mounted on a 1 U satellite, in a case-study mission. The temperature patterns in the array are evaluated during the orbital period, and the influence of the operative temperature on the antenna responses and gain was considered. We found that the thermal loads can affect the antenna matching. However, thanks to the optimized design, the proposed stacked antenna can operate from −100 $^{\circ }$C to 100 $^{\circ }$C, with an almost constant gain. Finally, following a damage-tolerant approach, the level of mechanical deformation, which could be induced on the communication system, was studied. The stress analysis reveals that the stacked geometry can be used in a space mission. From the investigation of the strain and displacement field, we found a negligible impact on the antenna performance.","2021","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","143-157","","","6","","IEEE Journal on Multiscale and Multiphysics Computational Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Broadband antennas; CubeSat; Geometry; Ka-band; multiphysics; particle swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Space vehicles; stacked antenna; Thermal analysis; thermal stresses; UHF antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its development takes a long time, high cost, and has a large risk of failure, and does not allow for testing new technologies to avoid the mission's failure. From these points of view, space-tested technologies were preferred to mitigate the risk of failure. Our goal is to build and test our own S-band communication subsystem for CubeSat. The system should be developed with reliable and compact hardware and flexible and efficient software. It consists of passive components such as the antennas and the filters and other active components. The passive components are designed, fabricated and measured while the active components are based on commercial components. In this paper, two antenna boards are designed; one board faces the earth and the other board lies on the opposite side. Each board has two antennas; transmitter and receiver antennas. The transmitter/receiver antennas are operating in the downlink /uplink at frequency bands from 2.2 GHz to 2.29 GHz and from 2.025 GHz to 2.11 GHz, respectively. This configuration keeps the communication between the CubeSat and the ground station to facilitate the de-tumbling process of the CubeSat. The second component is the filters that separate the transmitter from the receiver. The two filters have high roll off and narrow fractional bandwidth within a compact area. The transceiver system is based on the analog devices chip AD9361 controlled by zynq-7000 FPGA. The output RF signal is amplified to approach 33dBm output power to the antenna port via QORVO chip that operates in the range from 700MHz to 2700MHz. The antennas and filters are fabricated and tested where good results are noticed so that they are ready for integrating with the whole CubeSat communication subsystem.","2021","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","45123-45136","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antennas; Bandwidth; CubeSat; Dipole antennas; Faces; FPGA; hairpin filter; Receiving antennas; S-band antenna; satellite; transceiver system; Transmitting antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because they are cost-effective, and they can be built using commercial off-the-shelf components. Moreover, CubeSats can communicate with each other in space and ground stations to carry out many functions such as remote sensing (e.g., land imaging, education), space research, wide area measurements and deep space communications. Consequently, communications between CubeSats and ground stations is critical. Any antenna design for a CubeSat needs to meet size and weight restrictions while yielding good antenna radiation performance. To date, a limited number of works have surveyed, compared and categorised the proposed antenna designs for CubeSats based on their operating frequency bands. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on different antenna types with different operating frequency bands that are proposed for CubeSat applications. This paper reviews 48 antenna designs, which include 18 patch antennas, 5 slot antennas, 4 dipole and monopole antennas, 3 reflector antennas, 3 reflectarray antennas, 5 helical antennas, 2 metasurface antennas and 3 millimeter and sub-millimeter wave antennas. The current CubeSat antenna design challenges and design techniques to address these challenges are discussed. In addition, we classify these antennas according to their operating frequency bands, e.g., VHF, UHF, L, S, C, X, Ku, K/Ka, W and mm/sub-mm wave bands and provide an extensive qualitative comparison in terms of their size, -10 dB bandwidths, gains, reflection coefficients, and deployability.

The operating frequency is considered the primary factor that determines the antenna’s geometry, radiation characteristics, and suitability for mission objectives. The review focuses exclusively on experimentally realized and partially tested antenna designs, excluding projects that exist only as simulations or theoretical concepts. For each frequency band, typical antenna solutions, deployment mechanisms, and integration methods are examined in light of mission requirements and CubeSat form-factor constraints. In addition, a bibliometric analysis is provided to highlight trends in scientific publications and technological developments across the frequency spectrum.

This is crucial not only for conventional communication satellites like Geostationary Orbit (GEO) but also for those in lower orbits such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Key design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), and Side Lobe Level (SLL) for each beam. However, a challenge arises in multibeam scenarios when trying to simultaneously meet requirements for the aforementioned design factors which are reflected as uneven power distribution. This leads to over-saturation, especially in centrally located antenna elements due to the activation times per beam, commonly referred to as activation instances. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a method to balance the activation instances across antenna elements for each required beam. Our focus is on beams operating at 19 GHz on a CubeSat positioned 500 km above the Earth’s surface. We introduce a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based algorithm to optimize the beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix for each antenna element. A key constraint of this algorithm is a limit on activation instances per element, which avoids over-saturation in the Radio Frequency (RF) chain. Additionally, the algorithm accommodates beam requirements such as beamwidth, SLL, pointing direction, and total available power. With the previous key design factors, the algorithm will optimize the required genes to address the desired beam characteristics and constraints. We tested the algorithm’s effectiveness in three scenarios using an  $8\times 8$  DRA patch antenna with circular polarization, arranged in a triangular lattice. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only meets the required beam pattern specifications but also ensures a uniform activation distribution across the antenna array.","2024","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","2343-2357","","","5","","IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Antenna arrays; Antenna radiation patterns; Antennas; beamforming; CubeSat; direct radiating array; Earth; Phased arrays; satellite communications; Satellites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phased array adapts an on-chip monitor circuit which can be used to detect the amplitude and phase for calibration. The TX chip’s output 1 dB compression point (OP1dB) is 11dBm and saturated output power (Psat) is 12dBm for every path. The phased array can support single circular polarization (CP) and dual circular polarization modes. The maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single CP wave can reach 64.6 dBm under a power consumption of 37.4W. The error vector magnitude (EVM) of this work can support 256APSK modulation in both single CP mode (at 2 Gbaud symbol rate) and dual CP modes (at 250Mbaud symbol rate). As for beam steering ability, the phased array can cover a beam angle of ±66°. Compared to the conventional TX, this work has a larger beam angle and EIRP without sacrificing too much power consumption.","2025","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","148893-148901","","","13","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; CMOS process; dual-circular polarization; Insertion loss; low earth orbit satellites; Low earth orbit satellites; Monitoring; phased arrays; Phased arrays; Power demand; Printed circuits; Radio frequency; RF signals; Satellite broadcasting; Transmitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ShieldIt textile is used as the conducting element of the two designs based on two different unit cell arrays: a loaded circular patch unit cell or an unloaded circular patch unit cell, both backed by a generic rectangular element on its reverse side. This is in contrast to conventional frequency-selective structure-based linear-to-circular polarizers implemented using rigid substrates, which are multi-layered and requires inter-layer physical spacing. This complicates their implementation using flexible substrates and in a deployable format. Upon implementation of this double-sided polarizer, their final performances are evaluated in terms of the phase difference, conversion efficiency, 3-dB axial ratio (AR), and ellipticity bandwidth (from 40° to 45°). Measurements indicated good agreements with simulations, and both structures exhibited more than 90% of conversion efficiency from 2.34 to 3 GHz (for the loaded circular unit cell) and from 2.36 to 3 GHz (for the unloaded circular unit cell). In terms of ellipticity, a bandwidth of 8.67% is observed for the unloaded design and 13.82% for the loaded design. The unloaded structure exhibited a fractional 3-dB AR bandwidth of 36.36% (from 1.98 to 2.86 GHz) in simulations, and 32.64 % (from 2.00 to 2.78 GHz) when evaluated experimentally. Conversely, the loaded design showed only 12.58%. An equivalent circuit model is proposed and validated via a comparison between the circuit and full-wave simulations. Finally, the performances of these polarizers are also assessed under different bending conditions due to the use of flexible materials, prior to the proposal of a suitable deployment mechanism.","2019","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","2034-2041","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bandwidth; Electric fields; Flexible polarizer; linear-to-circular polarization; Load modeling; Microstrip antenna arrays; pico-satellite; Substrates; Topology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the targeted applications are related to broadband and narrowband communications, Earth observation, synthetic aperture radar, and internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity. In addition to these targeted applications, there is yet-to-be-harnessed potential for LEO and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, or what is nowadays referred to as LEO-PNT. No commercial LEO-PNT solutions currently exist and there is no unified research on LEO-PNT concepts. Our survey aims to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding what a LEO-PNT system entails, its technical design steps and challenges, what physical layer parameters are viable solutions, what tools can be used for a LEO-PNT design (e.g., optimisation steps, hardware and software simulators, etc.), the existing models of wireless channels for satellite-to-ground and ground-to-satellite propagation, and the commercial prospects of a future LEO-PNT system. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary survey is provided by a team of authors with complementary expertise in wireless communications, signal processing, navigation and tracking, physics, machine learning, Earth observation, remote sensing, digital economy, and business models.","2022","2025-11-07 22:11:30","2025-11-07 22:11:30","","83971-84002","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Broadband antennas; Constellation design; Earth; LEO business models; low earth orbit positioning; Low earth orbit satellites; Modulation; navigation and timing; receiver optimisation; Satellite broadcasting; Satellite navigation systems; satellite-to-ground channel models; Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
