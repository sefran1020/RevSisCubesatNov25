2020;"Platero, Valorie; Ferguson, Philip; Jayaraman, Raghavan; Isleifson, Dustin";2-In-1 smart panels: Embedding phased array patch antennas within satellite structures;The increasing commercialization of space missions call for versatile subsystems that make efficient use of limited spacecraft volumes. Smart panel technology that provides both mechanical and electrical functionality is a beneficial solution to spacecraft miniaturization. Combining different subsystems that are usually developed independently of each other is an innovative approach to space system design. Embedding antennas within satellite structural components reduces the overhead required for integrating numerous systems and maximizes space for the payload and other critical instruments. Microstrip patch antennas provide a low profile, light weight, small-dimension and easily manufactured solution to small satellite communication. The phased array functionality of the antenna enables dynamic beamforming for maximum versatility. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of an embedded phased array microstrip patch antenna with a hybrid composite structural panel comprised of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite (CFC), Polyethylene fiber reinforcedpolyethylene composite (PFC) (HDPE), and aluminium, with SU-8 as the antenna substrate. The embedded antenna panels are designed to be adaptable for any function and size required by the end user. We present the design of the smart panel antenna modelled using electromagnetic simulation software. The CFC and PFC materials are modelled with approximations of their electrical properties derived from experimental S-parameter and impedance measurements. The simulated antenna's radiation performance such as half power beamwidth, efficiency and gain are evaluated. The performance characteristics of the simulated antenna design are used to evaluate its application and feasibility in systems integration, and different uses in case studies including radar mapping spacecraft, satellite constellations, and CubeSats.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

2019;"Ren, X.; Liao, S.; Xue, Q.";A Circularly Polarized Spaceborne Antenna with Shaped Beam for Earth Coverage Applications;Since the earth is spherical in shape, the paths from the satellite to various points on the earth are different in both the distance and atmospheric attenuation. In order to maintain approximately uniform effective signal strength on the surface of the earth, the radiation pattern of the antenna should be formed according to the shape of the earth. Former antennas for earth coverage purpose are either bulky or hard to realize the desired beam pattern within a wide angle range, making them unsuitable for small satellite applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel circularly polarized earth coverage antenna for spaceborne applications. The proposed antenna consists of a specially designed dielectric cylinder, in which a cavity backed patch antenna is embedded. With the help of the concave structure at the top of the dielectric cylinder, the refraction of electromagnetic wave can be controlled, and then the radiation pattern is shaped. A sequentially feeding network is designed to drive the antenna. To verify our concept, a prototype is fabricated and experiments are carried out. The simulation agrees well with the measurement.

2004;"Arnieri, E.; Boccia, L.; Amendola, G.; DI Massa, G.";A compact high gain antenna for small-satellites;In this paper it is proposed an innovative high gain microstrip antenna well suited for aerospace applications. The design rationale is based on the features of the Shorted Annular Patch (SAP) [ref. 1] antennas. These radiators have been studied for their radiation pattern flexibility features. The gain increase combined with the possibility to control the beam aperture can result highly beneficial in designing directive antennas of small and medium satellites. In addition to the radiation properties, SAP antennas have mechanical features well suited for application in space environment. In fact, shorted rings can be easily adapted to solutions employing suspended technology and high performance materials. This opportunity eliminates the problems arising from the sensitivity of the electrical characteristics of the substrates and the distortion generated by the diffraction of surface waves seems to be advisable. This configuration is easily accomplished as the central short provides a supporting element on which single or stacked SAPs can be build. The design is based on a SAP radiator integrated with a stacked parasitic element.

Plastic CubeSats are appealing candidates. To enable the use of this new generation of space systems, the challenge of designing suitable communication sub-systems must be faced. In this work, a 3Dprinted ABS antenna easily embeddable in a plastic CubeSat is proposed. The 3D-printed material has been characterized in terms of dielectric, mechanical and thermal properties, and the compliance with space requirements has been assessed. In particular, thermogravimetric and calorimetric tests have been carried out. Static and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed. To comply with the stringent weight and space requirements, the unique antenna design of a curved stacked patch has been proposed. The patch covers the uplink (2.025-2.11 GHz) and downlink (2.2-2.29 GHz) bands for Telemetry Tracking and Command (TT&C) applications, with an overall bandwidth of about 300 MHz (14%). Additionally, taking advantage of the curved shape, the proposed antenna shows a size reduction of the resonant length of about 34%. The size of the antenna is 71.5 71.5 13 mm3 and is characterized by a weight of only 51 g.

Therefore, a deployable volume-efficient Miura-ori (VEMO) reflectarray aperture is presented that achieves high gain (35.3-dBi) and high volume efficiency (96%). The design is based on a modified Miura-Ori origami folding pattern that allows for ultra-high volume efficiency and simple deployment. In its stowed state, the aperture fits in a cuboid volume (8.0-cm ×8.0 -cm ×2.5 -cm) that occupies just 16% of the volume of a 1U CubeSat. The aperture is deployed by releasing stored energy from strategically placed neodymium magnets in the magnetic longitudinal offset (MaLO) hinge system. The aperture has a large reflecting surface area (24.8-cm ×24.8 -cm) that is stabilized by the MaLO hinges. The antenna operates in the Ka-band (38-GHz), and provides low side lobe level (-17.5-dB), high cross-polarization discrimination (37.1-dB), and acceptable efficiency (27.4%). The main advantage of the proposed VEMO RA antenna is that it achieves high gain with a design that is straightforward, low-cost, and easily deployable while occupying only a small portion of the payload volume.

It is a challenging to design an antenna with the limited space of a CubeSat platform. To improve the space utilization, an antenna is designed inspired by the concept of structure reuse. A meshed-like-structure is designed, which works as the radiator of a microstrip antenna at UHF band. However, it works as a partial reflective sheet for a Fabry-Perot resonator cavity antenna at C-band. Therefore, a microstrip patch antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator cavity antenna share only single aperture. A shaped ground is used to decrease the resonance at the lower band. Then, the aperture of the antenna is only 0.3λ 0 ,× , 0.3λ 0 , which makes it easy to integrate with a 1U CubeSat. The measurement reveals that the antenna has a common bandwidth of ( | S 11 < -10 dB, AR < 3 dB) 1% and 1.4%, an isolation higher than 35 and 20 dB, a peak gain of 5.82 and 13.75 dBic at UHF and C-band, respectively.

A CP stacked microstrip patch antenna is used as the element radiator with a structural modification on the parasitic patch to minimize gain variation. Since the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the element radiator is inherently narrow, sequential rotation is employed to yield a wide AR bandwidth while forming the $2\times 2$ subarray, which is then used as a building block to construct the larger $8\times 8$ phased array. The phased array has a simulated scan range of ±51°, $\boldsymbol {\pm }46^{\circ }$ , and $\boldsymbol {\pm }36^{\circ }$ at 23, 24, and 26.5 GHz, respectively, assuming $\boldsymbol {\le }3$ dB scan loss and AR. A beamforming network (BFN) is integrated within the stackup of the phased array that comprises a commercially available silicon beamforming chip. This facilitates beam steering through the independent control of the input amplitudes and phases of the individual element radiators.

2024;"Esmail, B.A.F.; Isleifson, D.; Shafai, L.";A Ku-Band Compact Offset Cylindrical Reflector Antenna with High Gain for Low-Earth Orbit Sensing Applications;The rise of CubeSats has unlocked opportunities for cutting-edge space missions with reduced costs and accelerated development timelines. CubeSats necessitate a high-gain antenna that can fit within a tightly confined space. This paper is primarily concerned with designing a compact Ku-band offset cylindrical reflector antenna for a CubeSat-based Earth Observation mission, with the goal of monitoring Arctic snow and sea ice. The development of a Ku-band offset cylindrical reflector, with a compact aperture of 110 × 149 mm2 (6.3λ × 8.5λ), is described alongside a patch array feed consisting of 2 × 8 elements. The patch array feed is designed using a lightweight Rogers substrate and is utilized to test the reflector. Adopting an offset configuration helped prevent gain loss due to feed blockage. Analyzing the reflector antenna, including the feed, thorough simulations and measurements indicates that achieving a gain of 25 dBi and an aperture efficiency of 52% at 17.2 GHz is attainable. The reflector’s cylindrical shape and compact size facilitate the design of a simple mechanism for reflector deployment, enabling the antenna to be stored within 1U. The array feed and reflector antenna have been fabricated and tested, demonstrating good consistency between the simulation and measurement outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

2022;"Zalfani, N.; Beldi, S.; Lahouar, S.; Besbes, K.";A miniaturized planar meander line antenna for UHF CubeSat communication;The use of LoRa (Long Range) wireless communication as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) protocol has great potential. This technology works in the unlicensed ISM band and covers all the globe with different frequencies, which can improve the wide and rapid spread of information. To obtain global IoT coverage using LoRa, the use of satellite networks is mandatory. The development of nanosatellites, mostly in the CubeSat form factor, for communication applications in general and LoRa communication in particular, is currently increasing. To date, these satellites usually use linear wire deployable antennas for communication. However, deployable mechanical systems present the risk of failure during the mission. In fact, one-unit CubeSat geometry allows a very small space (10 cm * 10 cm * 0.06 cm) for the antenna. Since the size of the antenna is proportional to wavelengths, the antenna size is a large problem for low frequencies, especially in the UHF band. For this reason, planar antennas are an attractive solution for CubeSat communications. This work presents the design of a miniaturized printed monopole meander line antenna working at a frequency of 920 MHz. The novelty of the design is obtained by placing the meander line and the ground plane onto similar sides of the antenna. The meander line allows reduction of the antenna size by a factor of λ/5 for the selected operating frequency.

Due to the introduction of the CLS, the unit patch element becomes multi-resonant and miniaturized. Besides, the outer length and width of the CLS are one-to-one related to the length of the patch. As a result, more than 480° phase range with quite good linearity is achieved. In addition, the phase ranges are almost parallel to each other from 22.5-26.5 GHz, which signifies its broadband property. Using such 36× 36 CLS patches in a square aperture of 180 mm ×180 mm size, an offset-fed reflectarray is constructed for an off-broadside radiation pattern. A prototype has been fabricated to experimentally validate the numerical results obtained using CST full-wave simulations.

This paper proposes a solar panel-integrated modified planner inverted F antenna (PIFA) to mitigate these crucial limitations. The antenna consists of a slotted rectangular radiating patch with coaxial probe feeding and a rectangular ground plane. The proposed antenna has achieved a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 6.0 MHz (447.5 MHz–453.5 MHz) with a smallsized (80 mm× 90 mm× 0.5 mm) radiating element. In addition, the antenna achieved a maximum realized gain of 0.6 dB and a total efficiency of 67.45% with the nanosatellite structure and a solar panel. The challenges addressed by the proposed antenna are to ensure solar panel placement between the radiating element and the ground plane, and provide approximately 55% open space to allow solar irradiance into the solar panel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: solar panel;;;;

It provides a succinct examination of various categories of materials used in three-dimensional (3D) and 4D printing, including the utilization of smart materials available in both printable and synthesized forms. The review encompasses a concise analysis of fabrication techniques, stimuli, and response behaviors applied in various types of smart materials. These materials have the potential to fabricate antennas with tunable and reconfigurable properties, including frequency of operation, bandwidth, gain, and radiation pattern. Given the novelty of applying 4D printing in antenna technologies, the review also considers additional reconfigurable antennas with mechanically tunable properties, as well as those in non-printed formats.

2015;"F. E. Tubbal; R. Raad; K. -W. Chin";A Survey and Study of Planar Antennas for Pico-Satellites;Works on pico-satellites have gained momentum recently, especially those that consider pico-satellites as part of a much larger constellation or swarm. This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size (34 × 13 mm2) and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide -10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of -15.2 dB.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

As a result, metasurface antennas, due to their subwavelength profile, have started to attract interest from space agencies and industry as an alternative to reflector-based antennas. Compared to reflector-based antennas, metasurface antennas lend themselves to low-cost fabrication technologies, including PCB technology and additive manufacturing, etc. Furthermore, the subwavelength texturing of metasurfaces provides additional degrees of freedom, allowing for extreme beamforming, polarization control, and multiband operation. In this abstract, an all-metal dual-beam metasurface antenna for small platform space Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems is proposed. The antenna's main beams overlap within their 3dB beamwidth, increasing the SAR system resolution without compromising its swath coverage. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the antenna consists of a waveguide-fed metasurface-based beamformer that excites an array of resonant slotted waveguides. In addition to beamforming, the metasurface isolates the input feeds. The metasurface-based beamformer consists of a multi-layer metasurface placed inside an over-moded waveguide, connected to the input feeds at one end and the slotted waveguides at the other. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;
2014;"Amend, O.; Bauer, F.H.; White, R.";Amateur Radio on ISS (ARISS) - A stem oriented educational opportunity;"Amateur Radio contacts with schools are a constant part of the crew's tasks since launch of the ISS, the history reaches back to former MIR and Space Shuttle missions. Amateur Radio Satellites were launched since 1961, currently more over 70 amateur radio satellites have been launched. In addition, several university satellites, Cubesats and Nanosats are also frequently using amateur radio frequencies. Lots of them are operational, offering voice and digital communication capabilities. ARISS (Amateur Radio on ISS) is a world-wide volunteer network using amateur radio frequencies to enable contacts between schools and astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, ARISS develops hardware, manages and organizes its use for educational purposes on ISS. A new experiment is recently installed within the ISS COLUMBUS module, called ""HAM Video"". Two Patch Antennas on the nadir side of the COLUMBUS module are used to transmit cabin video using standard DVB-S type signals on S-Band towards the earth. These transmissions will extend the current radio-based bi-directional ARISS school ""HAM Radio"" contacts to a new ""HAM TV"" service by providing a video signal downlink in parallel to amateur radio voice transmissions. This paper will describe the possibilities to use the International Space Station and its various amateur radio equipment and transmissions for educational purposes. Starting from prediction of satellite passes to building own reception equipment like antennas and radios to reception and decoding of the signals and measurements using these received signals offers various possibilities for school groups and interested individuals to participate. Technology demonstrators like Ham Video transmissions using DVB-S standard in S-Band offers modern possibilities for interested pupils to design and optimize their receiving station. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.";0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;
2023;"Nichols, M.W.; Gonzalez, A.; Alwan, E.A.; Volakis, J.L.";An Accordion-Folding Series-Fed Patch Array With Finite Thickness: A folding technique for CubeSat arrays;Combining antenna arrays with physical reconfigurability (i.e., origami) allows for additional degrees of freedom in operation and enables larger structures to be folded into smaller volumes. The packaging ability of origami antennas is of great interest for CubeSat applications in particular. However, traditional origami is based on the manipulation of thin sheets, making physical reconfigurability with thick substrates very difficult. In this article, we present a foldable series-fed patch array designed on a strictly rigid printed circuit board (PCB). Notably, the array does not require any external mechanical folding appendages (i.e., brackets, tapes, or offsets), and it can be manufactured using commercially available PCBs and equipment. The PCB itself is strategically cut to form lamina emergent torsion (LET) joints. When fully deployed, the array operates at 5.7 GHz. A significant shift is not seen in the operational frequency until the folding exceeds 60° (5.7-5.61 GHz). This shows that the array, even in a state of near extreme faulty deployment, will operate as intended. An 8 × 6 prototype array was fabricated using a Rogers DiClad 880. When fully deployed, the array is extended in a surface area of 280 × 198 × 1.524 mm and can be folded into a 35.5 × 198 × 12.5-mm compartment. The array held its integrity well after 100 cycles. (One cycle starts at a state of full deployment, moves to a state of being fully packaged, and goes back to a state of full deployment.) Measurements show that the active reflection coefficients are in good agreement with the finite array simulations. The measured realized gains at 5.7 GHz for 0° and 30° folds were 22.4 and 21.4 dBi, respectively. At the 60° fold, a realized gain of 20.6 dBi was achieved at the frequency of 5.61 GHz. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: mechanical folding;;;;

2021;"H. H. Abdullah; A. Elboushi; A. E. Gohar; E. A. Abdallah";An Improved S-Band CubeSat Communication Subsystem Design and Implementation;"In the past decade, the majority of the launched satellites have a weight exceeds 1 Ton. Its development takes a long time, high cost, and has a large risk of failure, and does not allow for testing new technologies to avoid the mission's failure. From these points of view, space-tested technologies were preferred to mitigate the risk of failure. Our goal is to build and test our own S-band communication subsystem for CubeSat. The system should be developed with reliable and compact hardware and flexible and efficient software. It consists of passive components such as the antennas and the filters and other active components. The passive components are designed, fabricated and measured while the active components are based on commercial components. In this paper, two antenna boards are designed; one board faces the earth and the other board lies on the opposite side. Each board has two antennas; transmitter and receiver antennas. The transmitter/receiver antennas are operating in the downlink /uplink at frequency bands from 2.2 GHz to 2.29 GHz and from 2.025 GHz to 2.11 GHz, respectively. This configuration keeps the communication between the CubeSat and the ground station to facilitate the de-tumbling process of the CubeSat. The second component is the filters that separate the transmitter from the receiver. The two filters have high roll off and narrow fractional bandwidth within a compact area. The transceiver system is based on the analog devices chip AD9361 controlled by zynq-7000 FPGA. The output RF signal is amplified to approach 33dBm output power to the antenna port via QORVO chip that operates in the range from 700MHz to 2700MHz. The antennas and filters are fabricated and tested where good results are noticed so that they are ready for integrating with the whole CubeSat communication subsystem.";0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

The bandwidth improvement comes from two meshed square patches that are placed on top of each other and have two close resonance frequencies. The first design consists of two Fused Silica glass substrates with an overall height of 5 mm in which the first layer acts as both antenna's substrate and solar cell cover glass. The antenna demonstrates an impedance bandwidth of 6.1%, peak gain of 6.9 dBi, and efficiency higher than 90%. The results were a motivation for further exploration of the performance of the stacked antenna with a sacrificial polymer material between two patches resulting in a lightweight antenna. The second antenna is lighter by 30% at the expense of lower efficiency. Further weight reduction is applied by partially removing the sacrificial polymer.

In recent years, GNSS-R has been increasingly used in land and marine environmental monitoring, with applications expanding to other emerging fields in EO. The so called Delay Doppler Map (DDM) is the primary observable of GNSS-R receivers, providing information on surface properties, i.e. dielectric constant and surface roughness. Efficient on-board processing is essential in CubeSat-based GNSS-R missions, due to the large volume of raw data and the constraints of limited downlink bandwidth. However, limited on-board computational resources present challenges, as DDM generation requires intensive Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations. This study presents the design and development of a cost-effective and compact 0.5U GNSS-R CubeSat payload that optimizes the GNSS-R data processing technique by using the auxiliary data from the reference signals, such as Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) codes, and their Doppler frequencies in order to reduce the search space. This way the payload selectively processes the raw data, significantly reducing the computational load. The payload processing unit is implemented in Analog Devices ADRV9364 with a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor with a Zynq-7000 Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

2024;Adonis, J.;An X-band Reflectarray for Deep-Space CubeSat Transmission Utilizing Consumer-Grade Material;CubeSat is a pico-satellite standard that significantly lowers the barrier of entry for space research. While beneficial, the limitations to weight and form inhibit the capabilities of a CubeSat's antenna. As such, CubeSats are commonly used in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), as they are limited by antenna transmission strength and available power. Although within recent years, progress has been made into deep-space CubeSat applications. The reflectarray (RA) antenna is a compact, high-gain antenna (HGA), which is compatible with CubeSat and capable of transmission from Deep-Space. This paper explores the design and manufacture of a reflectarray and it's unit cell (UC), using consumer-grade FR-4 substrate to lower the barrier of entry to Deep-Space research. This demonstrates a frequency tolerant unit-cell with 308° range of reflection and 1.44dB resonance loss. The resulting RA provides 28.66dB gain to a linearly polarised signal, when operating at 9.5GHz. The printed antenna weighs 702g gross mass.

Another advantage of CubeSats is that they can form swarms to interact with each other via cross-link communications to carry out different functions such as enhancing the contact time with base stations and provide redundancy. These capabilities require high gain, wide bandwidth and low-profile antenna to establish the cross-link communications between the CubeSats and ground stations.

2021;"S. Abulgasem; F. Tubbal; R. Raad; P. I. Theoharis; S. Lu; S. Iranmanesh";Antenna Designs for CubeSats: A Review;Cube Satellites, aka CubeSats, are a class of nano satellites that have gained popularity recently, especially for those that consider CubeSats as an emerging alternative to conventional satellites for space programs. This is because they are cost-effective, and they can be built using commercial off-the-shelf components. Moreover, CubeSats can communicate with each other in space and ground stations to carry out many functions such as remote sensing (e.g., land imaging, education), space research, wide area measurements and deep space communications. Consequently, communications between CubeSats and ground stations is critical. Any antenna design for a CubeSat needs to meet size and weight restrictions while yielding good antenna radiation performance. To date, a limited number of works have surveyed, compared and categorised the proposed antenna designs for CubeSats based on their operating frequency bands. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on different antenna types with different operating frequency bands that are proposed for CubeSat applications. This paper reviews 48 antenna designs, which include 18 patch antennas, 5 slot antennas, 4 dipole and monopole antennas, 3 reflector antennas, 3 reflectarray antennas, 5 helical antennas, 2 metasurface antennas and 3 millimeter and sub-millimeter wave antennas. The current CubeSat antenna design challenges and design techniques to address these challenges are discussed. In addition, we classify these antennas according to their operating frequency bands, e.g., VHF, UHF, L, S, C, X, Ku, K/Ka, W and mm/sub-mm wave bands and provide an extensive qualitative comparison in terms of their size, -10 dB bandwidths, gains, reflection coefficients, and deployability.

2019;"Veljovic, M.; Skrivervík, A.K.";Aperture-Coupled Low-Profile Wideband Patch Antennas for CubeSat;This communication presents the design and measurement results of aperture-coupled stripline-fed wideband patch antennas for nanosatellite applications. The low-profile requirements lead to a strong back radiation from the coupling aperture. Instead of suppressing the resulting electric field in the feeding stripline, an advantageous field distribution is used to boost the electromagnetic coupling to the radiating element. This effect is achieved by enclosing the stripline feeding structure with vertical conductive walls, effectively creating a cavity. The obtained antenna has a low profile of 0.08~lambda 0 at 2 GHz and exhibits 3 dB gain and axial ratio bandwidths of 27% and 32%, respectively. The effect of cavity resonances is analyzed in detail and we show how it is used to reduce the interference in adjacent frequency bands.

2024;"Osipova, Ksenia; Camps, Adriano; Golkar, Alessandro; Ruiz-de-Azua, Joan A.; Fernandez, Lara; Garzaniti, Nicola";Architecting CubeSat constellations for messaging service, Part I;In today’s modern and globalized world, connectivity is a key factor for businesses, production facilities, sensor networks, and ordinary people. However, there are still populated areas which are not covered by ground-based telecommunications infrastructure. This is where telecommunication satellite constellations come in, as they can provide coverage to remote and uninhabited regions and fill existing connectivity gaps to ensure data transfer. LoRa is one of the technologies designed for data transmissions over long distances with low power consumption. Alongside with other technologies of the Low-Power Wide Area Network family, it is widely used for Internet of Things applications. LoRa chirp spread spectrum modulation is robust against the Doppler frequency shifts encountered in low earth orbits, and it has already been used in IoT satellite communications. Due to the low transmitted signal power, the achieved data rate is not high, making it a suitable technology for telecommunications payloads on CubeSat platforms for messaging services. As compared to existing traditional communication satellite systems, CubeSat constellations are low-cost and may offer an affordable connectivity service to developing regions. This study is divided in two parts. In Part I the demand model is built based on the population distribution not covered by cell towers. The LoRa link performance is analyzed, considering the impact of LoRa channel parameters variation, such as spreading factor and channel bandwidth, while satellite orbital height, transmission antenna beamwidth, and transmitter peak power have a direct impact on the payload mass. Among thousands of possible configurations, 73 feasible payload designs have been downselected. In Part II of the study, the satellite mass and the total system cost are estimated based on the payload parameters obtained. Messages transmission simulation via a constellation is conducted in order to identify optimal constellation architectures for messaging service, as well as the main drivers of the system economic profitability. The presented analysis results provide a deeper understanding of LoRa connectivity advantages and limitations together with the performance drivers, which will support the optimization of future LoRa-based satellite communication systems and other IoT satellite constellations.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

The science payload on MiRaTA consists of a triband microwave radiometer and global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (GPSRO) sensor. The microwave radiometer takes measurements of all-weather temperature (V-band, 50-57 GHz), water vapor (G-band, 175-191 GHz), and cloud ice (G-band, 205 GHz) to provide observations used to improve weather forecasting. The Aerospace Corporation's GPSRO experiment, called the compact total electron content and atmospheric GPS sensor (CTAGS), measures profiles of temperature and pressure in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (∼20 km) and electron density in the ionosphere (over 100 km). The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPSRO: 1) new ultracompact and low-power technology for multichannel and multiband passive microwave radiometers, 2) the application of a commercial off-the-shelf GPS receiver and custom patch antenna array technology to obtain neutral atmospheric GPSRO retrieval from a nanosatellite, and 3) a new approach to space-borne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements.

These beacons transmit unmodulated, phase-coherent waves in S-band frequencies. Many satellite applications require circularly polarized (CP) wideband antennas. Their compact size, lightweight, and simple fabrication method make CP antennas suitable for small satellite systems. The slot antenna has wideband impedance, but the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) is narrower compared to the impedance bandwidth (IBW). In this paper, a circularly polarized circular-slotted antenna (CSA) is proposed to enhance the ARBW and the antenna gain. A pair of asymmetrical rectangular slots, a simple 50 W feedline and a parasitic patch were introduced to a CSA to enhance the 3 dB ARBW and the antenna gain. Rectangular slots were inserted on the diagonal axis of the CSA, the feedline was shifted to the left side of the x-axis, and a parasitic patch was attached to the circular slot. The lengths of the rectangular slots correspond to the resonant frequency, and the parasitic patch width corresponds to the higher frequency of the 3 dB ARBW. The asymmetrical rectangular slots, the shifted feedline, and the parasitic patch successfully improved the measured 3 dB ARBW of the antenna by 787.5 MHz or 35.79%. The measured gain of a CSA with left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) was also improved by shifting the feedline and the rectangular slot, achieving a peak gain of 5 dBic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
2025;"Xu, W.J.; Wang, M.; Ma, H.F.";Babinet-duality-engineered lightweight spoof surface plasmonic leaky-wave antenna;Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) face challenges in achieving lightweight designs due to their wavelength-dependent characteristics, which usually lead to large antenna sizes. This work proposes a complementary configuration of traditional patch-coupled LWAs based on the Babinet-duality theory, incorporating perforated patch arrays on a dielectric substrate to reduce weight. By integrating complementary spoof surface plasmon polaritons (C-SSPPs) as the waveguide, coupled feeding to the perforated patches is realized. The frequency-dependent phase difference across the patches enables sectoral beam scanning from backward to forward, demonstrating typical LWA behavior. Experimental results show continuous backward-to-forward scanning over −59° to +25° across 4.5–9.5 GHz. Calculation results confirm a 35.3 % weight reduction compared to conventional LWAs of equivalent size, making it suitable for payload-sensitive platforms such as small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

Students from five nations (Japan, Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh) collaborated to develop a number of CubeSats with coordinated ground coverage, named 'Joint Global Multi-Nation BIRDS,' or abbreviated as 'BIRDS.' To establish the downlink communication between satellite and Earth, an UHF patch antenna was utilized.

The integrated system occupies a Cubesat volume of 0.25U employing an integrated transceiver, an up-down converter, and a chain of beamforming circuits to manage the phase and gain its elements. The array's elements are slot coupled microstrip antennas etched on an asymmetric PTFE substrate stack and have a 10dB impedance bandwidth of 900MHz, with a maximal 25dB return loss at 24GHz. Circular polarization is made possible by using a cross slot geometry. The beamforming technology is scalable, low-power, lightweight and made from commercially-off-the-shelf components requiring 0.5W for each 16-element at maximum gain. The transceiver technology is to be used at the C6 System Integration and Engine Test. Link budget estimates show that integrating the developed phased array with an existing ground station, having an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and gain-to-noise-temperature (G/T) of 41.5dBW and 4.7dB/K, results in improved data links compared to omnidirectional antennas from launchpad to low earth orbit.

The qualification of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) GPS receivers is discussed, and flight results of precise orbit and attitude determination are presented. Pseudorange and carrier phase errors amount to roughly 65 cm and 8 mm for the ionosphere-free dual-frequency combination, which compares favorably with other missions using fully qualified space GPS receivers and is mainly limited by choice of simple patch antennas without choke rings. Precise orbit determination of CASSIOPE using GPS observations can achieve decimeter-level accuracy during continued operations but suffers from onboard and mission restrictions that limit the typical data availability to less than 50% of each day and induce regular long-duration gaps of 4–10 h. Based on overlap analyses, daily peak orbit determination errors can, however, be confined to 1 m 3D on 84% of all days, which fulfills the mission needs for science data processing of other instruments. The attitude of CASSIOPE can be determined with a representative precision of about 0.2° in the individual axes using three GAP receivers and antennas. Availability of dual-frequency measurements is particularly beneficial and enables single-epoch ambiguity fixing in about 97% of all epochs.

2010;"Saberin, J.R.; Furse, C.";Challenges with optically transparent patch antennas for small satellites;Satellites have always played an important role in space. Their contributions for space research, extended global communications and surveillance have been instrumental for the advancement of the information age. As part of the effort to create this outer space network, small satellites that in average weigh less than 5 Kg are becoming important players in space communications. Limitations of surface area on small satellites leave barely enough room for solar cells, which are necessary to power the internal systems of the satellite. This repeatedly impedes the placement of external elements such as antennas. Without the required surface area for topical microstrip patches, complex and failure prone antennas, such as deployable parabolic reflectors, are often used. This adds substantially to cost and labor hours as well as the potential for failure. Transparent and conductive materials such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) have been used in the developed of topical patch antennas [1], [2] that could potentially be mounted on top of solar cells. ITO has a high optical transparency (90%-80%) at very thin depositions (100nm-1.2um) while maintaining a considerably high conductivity of 281319 S/m. However, at very thin depositions efficiency of patch antennas is severely handicapped by skin and ground effects. This paper presents a revised expression for surface resistivity that better accounts for these effects at both low frequencies (100MHz) and high frequencies (10 GHz). Furthermore, this paper addresses the challenges involved with patch antennas made from transparent materials for integration with solar cells. © 2010 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

In this paper this type of antenna is proposed which includes those characteristics. This antenna has a ground which is in a shape of square. On the upper portion, there is a patch which is also a square but two corner of that patch was slotted equally. Connection between patch and ground has been established by a coaxial probe. The patch of this antenna is fed through this probe. Creation of resonance is done by those slots which is created straightway of secondary diagonal of the patch. As this design is too simple so it'll be easier to integrate it on the satellite body. Those slots on the secondary diagonal side which is the modification of the patch, help to achieve resonance in the expecting frequency. Resonance is basically excited by these slots.

The proposed antenna array is characterized by characteristic mode analysis (CMA). One single element of the CP octagonal-ring slot antenna array consists of a C-shaped monopole on the upper layer functioning as the radiating patch; and an octagonal-ring slot patch on the lower layer functioning as the ground plane. The four elements are connected by a sequentially-rotated feed network to enhance the impedance bandwidth (IBW), axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW), and gain.

This integration is foreseen to be exploited in space by small satellites to enable wireless power transfer among them, while maintaining optimal solar power production, with no need for extra areas for the antenna subsystems. The proposed antenna arrays utilize a novel approach, where horizontal conductive strips of a meshed metallization are removed, to enhance transparency without compromising antenna performance. Two arrays are designed at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz, and the associated design choices and issues are discussed. The antenna metallizations make use of vertical strips only with a line spacing of 0.04\boldsymbol {\lambda } , found to be the best compromise to ensure maximal transparency and antenna performance, using low-cost printing technique on 110 mm \times 110 mm borosilicate glass. Simulations and experiments show that the underlying PV metallization patterns have a significant impact on the antenna radiation properties at the highest operating frequency of 5.8 GHz. In this case, a degradation of the antenna gain compared to the predictions is observed. Through a reverse-engineering method, this effect is modeled by the effective electromagnetic characteristics of the glass substrate, rather than by accounting for the pattern layout-wise. It is demonstrated that this choice enables an efficient yet accurate full-wave simulation of the entire system, suggesting the necessity for a co-design of the PV panel and the antenna to facilitate an accurate representation of the entire system and its current radiating characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

The antenna employs a truncated microstrip patch design combined with additional parasitic patches to achieve circular polarization. It is printed on an RT/duroid® 5880 substrate with a thickness of 0.6 mm and a relative permittivity of 2.2. The design consists of a central truncated radiating patch and four segment-circular parasitic patches, positioned near the edges of the substrate to enhance bandwidth and axial ratio performance, which is crucial for achieving circular polarization.

ShieldIt textile is used as the conducting element of the two designs based on two different unit cell arrays: a loaded circular patch unit cell or an unloaded circular patch unit cell, both backed by a generic rectangular element on its reverse side. This is in contrast to conventional frequency-selective structure-based linear-to-circular polarizers implemented using rigid substrates, which are multi-layered and requires inter-layer physical spacing. This complicates their implementation using flexible substrates and in a deployable format. Upon implementation of this double-sided polarizer, their final performances are evaluated in terms of the phase difference, conversion efficiency, 3-dB axial ratio (AR), and ellipticity bandwidth (from 40° to 45°). Measurements indicated good agreements with simulations, and both structures exhibited more than 90% of conversion efficiency from 2.34 to 3 GHz (for the loaded circular unit cell) and from 2.36 to 3 GHz (for the unloaded circular unit cell). In terms of ellipticity, a bandwidth of 8.67% is observed for the unloaded design and 13.82% for the loaded design.

Conversely, the loaded design showed only 12.58%. An equivalent circuit model is proposed and validated via a comparison between the circuit and full-wave simulations.

The main goal of such satellites is to serve as data relay for transmission of meteorological data collected by stations deployed in remote areas, such as in the rain forest, whereby no wired communication is possible.

The performance of such arrays is assessed including parameter variations, especially for the case of dielectric constant of the antenna substrate and misalignment in the orientation of the array elements. Such imperfections can occur due to mechanical stress and large temperature variations that are typical to the space environment.

In 2014, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities. One of the critical thrusts was the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 m, 35 GHz antenna in a 1.5U canister. At that time, there had been minimal development in high-gain CubeSat antennas, critical for high-data-rate communications and remote sensing science. A Ka-band high-gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. This paper discusses designing, building, integrating, and operating the flight antenna from a mechanical perspective, its final performance, and lessons learned. KaPDA enabled the RainCube mission, the first Earth Science CubeSat to have an active instrument. RainCube was launched in May 2018, making KaPDA the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat and the first to operate in Ka-band, enabling follow-on opportunities for high-rate antenna communications and remote sensing science. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: state-of-the-art;;;;

The proposed antenna is based on a planar rectangular patch configuration, featuring a microstrip planar patch attached to a coaxial SMA connector, and a second layer with a resonator and cavity model patch. The design methodology involves detailed calculations of the patch dimensions, effective permittivity, and matching impedance for a coaxial input of 50 Ohms. The truncated method is employed to achieve circular polarization, creating two orthogonal modes with a 90-degree phase difference by truncating the patch corners at 45 degrees. Parametric studies assess the impact of ground width, the gap between the resonator ring and main patch, and the gap between the top and bottom layers on the antenna's reflection coefficient (S11). The results indicate that a ground width of 46 mm and a 20 mm gap between the layers provide optimal impedance matching. The antenna's design is validated through simulation and practical implementation, demonstrating its effectiveness for CubeSat communication systems by achieving enhanced efficiency, reduced reflection, and improved overall performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

The antennas remain in a stowed configuration during launch and are deployed once the satellite reaches orbit. The deployment mechanism is designed to deploy the antenna in the required orientation and minimize potential failures. Material and stiffness for the antenna have been finalized considering several factors such as requirement, availability, and success rate of deployment. Principles used to decide the spring for deployment doors have been described in the paper. It has been ensured that the door remains locked in its position after deployment. Impact due to collision of the deployment doors with the satellite structure has also been computed. Ample measures have been taken to prevent deployment failure due to cold welding in space. The antennas have also been electrically insulated from the rest of the structure of the satellite. The contour for support of stowed antennas has been designed to minimize the stress acting on the stowed antenna to prevent deformation of the antenna. Space optimization considerations, among other factors, are described in this paper. A burn-wire mechanism has been used for deploying the antennas at the appropriate time. A feedback mechanism has also been integrated into the circuit to signal the successful deployment of the antennas.

High- and low-impedance radiating elements are designed, and design restrictions are introduced such that all other geometries may be solved through a set of simple cascading equations. These deliberate choices minimize the number of design parameters and simplify the design process.

2019;"Hörmer, A.J.; Zeif, R.; Teschl, F.; Wenger, M.; Koudelka, O.";Design of a high-gain microstrip patch antenna array with stripline combiners for passive reflectometry;PRETTY (Passive Reflectometry and Dosimetry) is a 3U CubeSat mission dedicated to Earth observation. The mission goal is to measure the Earth's surface by the use of passive reflectometry. Direct and reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are correlated to perform height measurements of the Earth surface, especially in polar regions. In addition, a miniaturized dosimeter payload quantifies the total ionizing dose as well as the linear energy transfer in the corresponding to the position in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This paper presents the design of the microstrip patch antenna array for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) passive reflectometry on the PRETTY CubeSat mission. The antenna allows the detection of both the direct signal and the reflected signal. Its antenna pattern is hence designed to have a high vertical aperture angle. To maximize the measurement performance, the perturbations and reflections outside the main lobe have to be kept as low as possible. Given these constraints, a 2x4 patch antenna array is used. The high gain of a patch array is required to provide sufficient amplification of the very weak GNSS-R signals, especially for the reflected ones. Based on the analysis results, a single element, as well as a 2x4 patch array, were designed with FEM simulation tools. Prototypes are manufactured and compared to the simulation results in terms of s-parameters, bandwidth, and gain. The results show a gain of over 13dB in the expected L1 frequency range and a bandwidth of about 10MHz. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

This paper presents a design of an X-band microstrip patch antenna using an electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure for CubeSat applications. The X-band is preferred for CubeSat missions in high-speed communication, long distance or deep space because it allows communication at higher data rates, and the antenna is smaller than those used for lower frequency bands. In our study, the EBG elements are analyzed, modified and optimized so that the antenna can fit a 10 cm × 10 cm surface area of a standard 3U CubeSat structure while providing a significant high gain and circular polarization (CP). A noticeable point of this research is that the simplicity of the antenna and the EBG structure are being maintained by just using a simple single-probe feed to achieve a total antenna efficiency exceeding 90%, and the measured gain of around 11.7 dBi at the desired frequency of 8.483 GHz. Furthermore, the measured axial ratio (AR) is around 1.4 dB at 8.483 GHz, which satisfied the lower-than-3 dB requirement for CP antennas in general.

To compensate, a Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. Unfortunately, high gain antenna developments to this point have only focused on S-band, which does not provide the required gain. Two years ago, JPL initiated a research and technology development effort to design a half-meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (15 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) and provide 42dB of gain (or 50% efficiency).

The constructed antenna was demonstrated to achieve a gain of 42.5 dB before deployment, and a gain of 42 dB after deployment.

This paper gives the overall structure and work principle of the high-directivity reconfigurable antenna. The antenna is simulated by full-wave EM simulation software CST. The directivity, beamscanning, and isolation performances are estimated. The directivity is range from 17.7 to 23.1dBi and 18.9 to 22.2dBi at low and high reconfigurable frequency bands, the beam scanning of over 30° is achieved. The analysis results show that the improvement of antenna gain is over 17.8dB by loading spherical lens on the reconfigurable feed antenna in the normal direction, approximately 60 times than the conventional reconfigurable antenna. The design issues, analysis processes and the potential applications on satellite communication of the proposed antenna are presented in detail. The proposed antenna could be a good substitution of phased array for low-cost and high-directivity small satellite communication applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: 3D-printed;;;;

This advancement, framed within the BIXO mission by the student team of UVigo SpaceLab at the University of Vigo, addresses the need for an advanced communication system for the efficient transmission of images, particularly in projects that house payloads such as cameras utilising software-defined radios in S-band. The educational significance of this project lies in the opportunity it offers students to engage in technological design and development processes, applying their theoretical knowledge in a practical context and gaining experience in the field of space engineering. This training focuses primarily on the design of the antenna and the planning and execution of the necessary tests to validate the antenna. The testing methodology adopted for the patch antenna was meticulously designed to ensure its optimal performance under specific operational conditions in space. This antenna testing model planned various tests in an anechoic chamber to evaluate the radiation pattern and the impedance of the antenna, ensuring its compatibility with the requirements of the BIXO mission. The antenna design was carried out using advanced electromagnetic simulation software, which allowed for the optimisation of its shape and dimensions to maximise performance in the S-band. Factors such as weight, size, and resistance to the space environment were considered to develop an antenna that not only met the technical specifications but also adapted to the physical limitations of CubeSats.

The NEXTSat-2 (Next-Generation Satellite II) is a small radar satellite primarily aimed at demonstrating locally developed SAR technology. it also serves additional purposes, including the verification of core space technologies and the measurement of space radiation. The satellite, having a total mass of 180 kg, was built for X-band SAR with the center frequency of 9.65 GHz and a look angle of 20∼35°. It can produce SAR imagery with the resolution of 5m and the swath of 40 km in StripMap mode.

Flight demonstration onboard a small satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is now under consideration. When a high power microwave is irradiated from antenna in LEO plasma environment, there is a concern about discharge caused by interaction between the plasma and the microwave. There has been no experimental observation on such interaction phenomenon. Verification experiment is essential for SSPS to become a reality. We have set-up an experimental system that can simulate the radiation of high power microwave under dense plasma in a vacuum chamber. A RF plasma source was installed to the chamber that we filled with Argon plasma environment of density from 1011 to 10 m' with 4eV to 6eV temperature under a back pressure of 2.6x10"" Pa. A patch antenna made of Glass epoxy substrate was installed inside the chamber. The antenna was connected to a magnetron that could produce 5.8GHz microwave. We monitored the antenna surface temperature, the radiated and reflected power, the chamber pressure and others while we injected the microwave to the antenna up to 45W. We examined whether discharge or related phenomena occur or not on the patch antennas for various conditions to verify the hypothesis of discharge inception that discharge is caused by multi-pactoring and breakdown of the outgas product.

2019;"Kingsbury, R.W.; Self, M.C.; Vittaldev, V.; Foster, C.";Dove GPS: An unconventional approach to cubesat orbit determination;Planet is a vertically integrated aerospace and data analytics company that operates the world's largest commercial fleet of satellites. Our mission is to image the whole world everyday, and make change visible, accessible, and actionable. We have launched over 300 satellites and built up an automated mission control and ground station infrastructure to monitor and control the satellites, and download the imagery data. The majority of these satellites are 3U cubesats known as “Doves”. Designing, building, and operating small satellites is replete with challenges, but one of particular interest is orbit determination. Independent orbit determination is an essential capability for responsibly operating small satellites. Public sources of ephemerides are known to be unreliable, especially during the launch and early operations phase of the mission as it is common for a given launch vehicle to deploy dozens of similar satellites in nearly identical orbits. Planet has invested in two independent, cooperative schemes for orbit determination: a time-of-flight ranging system using UHF radios and a GNSS-based system that uses the GPS L1 C/A signal. Unlike primary radar systems, both of these schemes are able to unambiguously identify each Dove. The Dove spacecraft is size, weight and power constrained. In the launch configuration, each satellite is roughly 30 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm with a mass of 5 kg. Volume constraints in particular made commercially available GNSS receiver modules unsuitable for this application. Since the Dove design already incorporated onboard compute and communication capabilities, we saw an opportunity to reuse those resources to provide a GNSS receiver solution. The only additional components that were needed for this receiver were a patch antenna, low-noise amplifier, SAW filter, and a GNSS RF front-end chipset. The volume, weight and power of these added components is 1 cm3, 1.5 g and 115 mW, respectively. Unlike most GNSS receivers, the Dove receiver does not provide real-time results. Rather, it works by way of taking short (32 ms) snapshots of the GPS L1 channel. These recordings are downlinked and post-processed using published GPS ephemerides and prior estimates of the satellite's orbits to obtain state vectors. GPS satellite geometry and received power are excellent from the Dove's nominal 500 km orbit (inside the Terrestrial Service Volume) which allows use of a small patch antenna. State vectors are ingested by our orbit-fitting service which in turn generates ephemerides for each of our satellites. An orbit model is fit to the GNSS state vectors via a non-linear least squares. The orbit model consists of a Cartesian state vector and ballistic coefficient numerically propagated under a force model with a GGM03C gravity field and the NRL-MSIS00 atmosphere model. The orbit fit process is run periodically against the most recent GNSS-derived state vectors. This entire processing flow is automated and runs on a scalable cloud compute solution. Moving GNSS sample processing off the satellite comes at the price of added latency to the orbit determination process. This is acceptable for our medium resolution (3.7 m Ground Sample Distance) imaging mission, however, it may not be applicable for systems with higher precision requirements or for missions with greater dynamics (e.g., satellites with propulsion capabilities). Nevertheless, it has proven to be a size, weight and power efficient approach for implementing GNSS reception on a small satellite. To date this solution has been used operationally on over 185 Dove satellites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

The proposed antenna is simulated based on computer simulation technology (CST) simulator with single proximity-coupled feeding, single patch, dual-band circularly-polarized microstrip antenna. The proposed antenna consists of ground and rectangular-formed radiating patch on the upper side with circularly-formed slot on the center of patch and the feeding line at bottom side. Between radiating patch, ground patch and feeding line have a substrate which have dielectric constant of 2.17, dissipation factor of 0.0005 and dielectric thickness of 1.6 mm. The investigation is performed by varying the length of feed line at bottom side and the size of parasitic rectangular patch at upper side. The length of feeding line has dominant effects to reflection coefficient of the lower band frequency and the size of parasitic small patch rectangular-formed have dominant effects to axial ratio on the higher band frequency. The characteristic of antenna parameters such as impedance bandwidth, axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) will be presented. From simulation result, the characteristic of proposed antenna has a good agreement between simulation and antenna requirements for nanosatellite antenna to transmit the beacon signal. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

The adopted folding and shorting technique for the individual patch elements, allows for size reduction of the conventional quarter-wavelength shorted patch. Also, to further miniaturize the array, the single-element FSPs are realized with meandering on the top-layer. These design approaches result in a compact array with a total size of 5 × 5 cm2 considering a 2 × 2 arrangement. This structure also offers dual-circularly polarized (DCP) radiation which is made possible by an eight-port feeding configuration for the array (i.e. two ports for each element). Given the dual-band nature of the individual FSPs, which is not typically exploited, the developed array is made operational for 1.1 GHz and 2.1 GHz. These features can simultaneously allow for downlink and uplink communications and/or satellite-to-satellite data links at L-band and S-band frequencies, while also, not consuming excessive area on the satellite itself. This is because the proposed 2 × 2 array can support these multiple transmitting and receiving functions, with a single antenna array structure for example, whilst leaving space on the CubeSat itself for other devices, sensors, solar panels, and deployable systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

The TA features a low-profile and lightweight microstrip aperture (103.4 mm  $\times 103.4$  mm  $\times 1.7$  mm), coupled with a commercial-off-the-shelf horn antenna for excitation. Our novel TA element is carefully designed to achieve high-efficiency transmission and independent phase control in both operating bands, while ensuring that its features can be fabricated using standard PCB manufacturing techniques. Additionally, by arranging the phase tuning mechanism for each band on opposite sides of the aperture, space is created to accommodate DC biasing circuitry for electronic beam scanning applications in future iterations of the design. A passive prototype of the TA was fabricated using conventional PCB and additive manufacturing techniques. The TA’s performance was validated with measurements that demonstrated high gain (22.9 dBi and 20.2 dBi), aperture efficiency (15.4% and 19.3%), and 1-dB gain bandwidth (4.3% and 13.4%) in the respective operating bands (29 and 19 GHz).

2016;"Shrestha, R.; Anagnostou, D.E.; Horst, S.J.; Hoffman, J.P.";Dual-frequency and dual-polarization antenna array for satellite deployment;The development of an aperture coupled microstrip dual-band and dual-polarization 6×6 antenna array system on RO4003C is presented. The antenna array has a multilayer structure that consists of square microstrip elements, placed on each substrate layer to provide dual frequency operation at 14 and 35 GHz. Dual polarization is achieved by using two right-angled microstrip lines and two perpendicular slots to feed the antennas. The microstrip feed line is placed orthogonally from the center of the slot on the ground plane between the substrates. The energy from the microstrip feed line is aperture coupled to each square antenna element through the slot. Two right-angled non-overlapping slots are used on each antenna to enable the two different polarization states. The antenna array has 14 GHz patches on the top substrate layer and 35 GHz patches on the lower substrate layer in order to maintain a similar percentage bandwidth. The microstrip feed lines are located at the bottom of the feed substrate. A symmetric feed structure is followed for the antenna array. The aperture coupling feeding network has the advantage of reduced spurious radiation compared to edge or probe feeds as it utilized highly linearly polarized feed lines and slots, and a large ground plane to prevent backside radiation. The designed antenna array has linear polarization at 45-degrees and 135-degrees at the Ku- and Ka-frequency bands. The array is designed using a hybrid simulation scheme in Keysight Advance Design System (ADS). The ADS Schematic is used for the feed network while the ADS Momentum is used for the antenna elements and the entire array structure simulations. In this way, all aspects of the design (microstrip antenna elements and feed lines) can be optimized independently. This array is suitable for airborne (small remotely piloted), and small-satellite NASA flight programs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

This paper puts forth the study, done through simulations, of the impact of a massive reflecting sail on the operation of a system of antennas and changes in link time associated with the COEPSAT-2 mission. The solar sail under consideration is a large 40 square meter reflective film made of a polymer substrate, providing a reflectivity of around 90 per cent, which causes changes in the antenna radiation pattern, gain, VSWR and beam width. The system of antennas to be employed in COEPSAT-2 comprises a pair of dipole antennas for data uplink and downlink and a rectangular microstrip patch antenna for GPS signal reception. Due to the reflecting nature of the solar sail, the omnidirectional radiation patterns of the dipole antennas obtain directional properties. Besides, the orientations of the satellite are so chosen as to assist solar sailing and are not typically favorable for communication. Nonetheless, addition of the sail shows an increase in the maximum gain of all the antennas and their corresponding half-power beam width angle. Consequently, there is a significant improvement in the communication link percentage (ratio of link time to pass time) - from around 35 per cent to nearly 100 per cent. The communication feasibility has been inferred from the link time and link budget analysis. The link time has been obtained from simulations performed for different TLEs (two-line element set) of the satellite over one year for nadir pointing and orbit raising orientations. A comparative analysis of the antenna parameters before and after the deployment of sail and its subsequent effect on the link budget and link time is presented and the results are corroborated by extensive simulations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

Our goal is to eliminate a maximum number of antenna elements with minor gain loss and hence reduce the array size, weight, cost, and power requirements. Consequently, the space saved by the thinned array configuration presents opportunities to integrate additional antennas and hardware, allowing for a low-profile antenna-in-package. Our study showed that a 64% array reduction (from 25 to 9 probe-fed patch antennas) achieved an array gain comparable to a full array configuration. As such, various 9-element configurations for testing were generated through the thinning process and optimized using the genetic algorithm. These configurations were then validated using full-wave simulations. Results show that all configurations that preserved the effective area while maintaining symmetry along all axes showed a minimal effect on gain reduction. Specifically, the best thinning configuration resulted in a loss of only 1.82 dB in simulation at broadside compared to a fully populated  $5\times5$  array.

We propose a single-frequency, single-station RTK relative navigation system specifically designed for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and adapted from ground-based RTK systems. To achieve precise relative navigation, we analyze the statistical characteristics of integer ambiguity in carrier-phase measurements, starting with pseudorange-based differential GPS relative navigation. Instead of using the conventional extended Kalman filter, we introduce a recursive ambiguity filter based on weighted least squares, improving the float solution for ambiguity estimation without requiring complex filter designs. By deriving the statistical characteristics and the spatial metric known as ambiguity dilution of precision, we establish a strategy to achieve a 100 % success-fix rate in integer ambiguity resolution, utilizing the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment method for RTK relative navigation. The proposed algorithm's reliability is validated through software-based LEO simulators and ground-based experimental hardware that uses GPS receivers and patch antennas mounted on the SNUGLITE-III CubeSat.

CubeSats are used for space research, but their low-rate communication capability limits functionality. As greater payload and instrumentation functions are sought, increased data rate is needed. Since most CubeSats currently transmit at a 437 MHz frequency, several directional antenna types were studied for a 2.45 GHz, larger bandwidth transmission. This higher frequency provides the bandwidth needed for increasing the data rate. A deployable antenna mechanism maybe needed because most directional antennas are bigger than the CubeSat size constraints.

When comparing the prototype antenna's maximum transmission distance to the other commercial antennas, the prototype outperformed all commercial antennas, except the patch antenna.

2020;"Ivanov, D.; Barschke, M.F.; Ovchinnikov, M.; Briess, K.";Flight results from a passively magnetic stabilized single unit cubesat;BEESAT-3 is an educational single unit CubeSat mission with the objective to demonstrate an S-band transmitter and a small camera in low Earth orbit. As the transmitter uses a patch antenna with an opening angle of eighty degrees for downlink, the satellite needs to be orientated towards the ground station for data transmission. Considering the moderate pointing requirements, attitude control was implemented as fully passive system based on a permanent magnet and a hysteresis plate in order to limit the complexity of the spacecraft. However, Sun sensors and gyroscopes were implemented to allow for an evaluation of the attitude alignment while passing the ground station. After the launch of BEESAT-3 in April 2013, no whatsoever signal could be received from the spacecraft. However, after nearly five years in orbit, in January 2018, the first successful contact to the satellite could be established and after a significant upgrade of the ground station antenna all mission objectives could be met in the subsequent months.

The satellite carries various technology demonstration payloads, among them the Navigation and Occultation experiment (NOX). This payload consists of a geodetic-grade GPS receiver, which is connected via an antenna selector to two GPS L1/L2 patch antennas. One of the antennas is mounted on the satellite's zenith panel and receives signals primarily used for precise orbit determination (POD) experiments. The second antenna is pointed towards the anti-flight direction of the satellite for collecting measurements of low elevation satellites for ionospheric and tropospheric occultations. The antenna switch allows to select either the POD or the occultation antenna for signal reception. This paper describes the NOX payload onboard the TET satellite in detail. The receiver's tracking performance and the accuracy of the navigation solution is analyzed.

Antennas, as key components of the CubeSat communication subsystem, must be designed under strict constraints regarding size, mass, and power consumption. This review article presents a frequency-oriented classification of antennas developed and studied for CubeSat platforms over the past decade, covering frequency ranges from very high frequency (VHF) to millimeter waves. The operating frequency is considered the primary factor that determines the antenna’s geometry, radiation characteristics, and suitability for mission objectives. The review focuses exclusively on experimentally realized and partially tested antenna designs, excluding projects that exist only as simulations or theoretical concepts. For each frequency band, typical antenna solutions, deployment mechanisms, and integration methods are examined in light of mission requirements and CubeSat form-factor constraints. In addition, a bibliometric analysis is provided to highlight trends in scientific publications and technological developments across the frequency spectrum.

However, until recently, there has been very limited development in the area of high gain CubeSat antennas, which are critical for both high data rate communications and radar science. A Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. Because of this, three years ago the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities, with one of the key thrusts being the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 meter, 35 Ghz antenna in a 1.5U canister. This paper discusses the process of taking the antenna from a first prototype to the flight design, how the design successfully met its goals, and lessons learned. A prototype antenna was constructed in early 2015, and then upgraded to an engineering model at the end of 2016. KaPDA will be flying on the RainCube mission, and Earth Science CubeSat.

The proposed antenna combines an aperture coupled feeding with a T-slot, four metallic vias and a patch with a diagonal slot to present high gain and wide 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth (BW) characteristics. In this study, a rectangular patch (0.6 λ<inf>0</inf> × 0.5 λ<inf>0</inf> at f = 7.5 GHz) with a diagonal slot has been symmetrically located above the T-slot at the height of 0.07 λ<inf>0</inf>. A WR<inf>90</inf> waveguide with the length of 50 mm and a T-slot in its extended outer wall has been used as a primary antenna that feeds the patch element. Four metallic vias with shunt inductive effects have been used to virtually enlarge radiating patch dimension, so they present a significant improvement in antenna gain, BW and axial ratio.

The antenna is based on a multi-layer element structure consisting of two dielectric substrates made of Taconic TLY-5 and three copper layers (i.e., the parasitic patch (top layer), the active patch (middle layer), and the ground plane (bottom layer)). The parasitic patch resides on the bottom surface of the upper TLY-5 substrate while the active patch is printed on the top surface of the lower substrate. A Rohacell foam material is sandwiched between the top layer and the middle layer to separate the two dielectric substrates in order to achieve high directivity, wideband, and to keep the antenna weight to a minimum as required by the SAR satellite application. To satisfy the required size of the antenna panel for the small SAR satellite, an asymmetric corporate feeding network (CFN) is designed to feed a 12 × 16 planar array antenna. However, it was determined that the first corporate feed junction at the center of the CFN, where higher amplitudes of the input signal are located, contributes significantly to the leaky wave emission, which degrades the radiation efficiency and increases the sidelobe level. Thus, a suspended microstrip slab, which is simply a wide and long microstrip line, is designed and positioned on the top layer directly above that feed junction to prevent the leaky waves from radiating. The experimental results of the antenna show good agreement with the simulated ones, achieving an impedance bandwidth of 12.4% from 9.01 to 10.20 GHz and a high gain above 28 dBi.

The proposed pixel patch design area reduction is about 75%, and the full design area reduction is about 90%, compared to conventional patches. The pixel design parameters of these antennas are carefully examined to increase their gain, radiation pattern, and efficiency. For a variety of applications, increased gain and various radiation pattern configurations may be advantageous. As a result, increasing the coverage of 5G, 6G, and small satellites requires antennas with a small size, higher gain, and better radiation patterns. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

2017;"Grau, S.; Tschoban, C.; Lang, K.-D.; Briess, K.";Highly integrated communications, power management, and attitude determination and control side panel for CubeSats;Recent development in highly integrated side panels for CubeSats has seen the integration of attitude determination and control system components together with components of the electronic power supply system. Complemented by the communications system, these three systems form the core of any nanosatellite mission. Their special importance can also be seen in the amount of mass, volume, and electronic power consumption they account for on CubeSat missions. The more precise the attitude determination and control system of a CubeSat becomes, the less resources are available for payloads on such satellites. To allow for larger payloads a highly integrated CubeSat side panel was developed at Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. This side panel comprises commercial off-the-shelf MEMS sensors for attitude determination and housekeeping, space-graded solar cells, a solar antenna, and two attitude actuators. Dual three-axis rate gyroscopes together with dual three-axis magnetic field sensors and a sun sensor based on a position sensitive device are used for attitude determination. The efficiency of the solar cells is increased by using a maximum power point tracking algorithm that is running on a microcontroller which is located on the side panel. A solar cell was combined with a S band patch antenna to form a so-called solar antenna. The solar antenna allows for high data rate downlink while keeping the loss in effective solar cell area on the side panel at a minimum. Coarse attitude control is realized by an electro-magnetic coil that is integrated inside the printed circuit board of the side panel. For precise and agile attitude control a newly developed fluid-dynamic actuator for picosatellites is mounted on the side panel. The two actuators together with the sensors and the microcontroller allow for local preprocessing of attitude determination and control, thus freeing the on-board computer from these tasks. The design of the printed circuit board makes it possible to produce different variants of the side panel, for example by substituting the solar antenna with a larger solar cell and by removing the fluid-dynamic actuator. Significantly larger payloads are enabled by implementing the highly integrated side panel on CubeSat missions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

Perturbations in the diagonal corners of a square ring and a square patch arranged in a stacked configuration are introduced to achieve the circular polarization. First, an enhanced AR bandwidth is obtained when a combination of a square ring and a square patch with negative perturbations is used as parasitic and driven elements, respectively. Next, circular polarization with wider AR bandwidth, wider beamwidth, and lower cross-polarization is obtained when a combination of a driven square patch with positive perturbation and a parasitic square ring with negative perturbations, termed as hybrid perturbations, is used.

The satellite will carry five GNSS patch antennas, each connected to two independent u-blox multi-GNSS receivers. These very small, commercially available low-cost receivers are able to track single-frequency code and phase data of all the major GNSS, i.e. GPS, GLONASS, QZSS, Beidou (and ready for Galileo). Four main science objectives have been defined for the CubETH mission: (1) precise orbit determination using low-cost GNSS receivers, (2) attitude determination based on very short baselines, (3) comparison of the performance in space between GPS and GLONASS (and possibly other GNSS) as an important step for farther developments of space-bome GNSS receivers, (4) additional experimental measurements (e.g. for air density estimation during re-entry). The satellite will carry 3 retro-reflectors to enable satellite laser ranging for performance validation of the precise orbit determination. Novel CubeSat technologies will also be tested. We will take into account lessons learned from the SwissCube mission, which is in operation since 2009. A new modular design for the structure as well as connectors will be flown. We also intend to demonstrate the use of a miniaturized low-power command and data handling system, which shall control the satellite.

2024;"Schreiter, L.; Brack, A.; Männel, B.; Schuh, H.; Arnold, D.; Jäggi, A.";Imaging of the Ionosphere and Plasmasphere Using GNSS Slant TEC Obtained From LEO Satellites;Satellites with dual-frequency Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers can measure integrated electron density, known as slant Total Electron Content (sTEC), between the receiver and transmitter. Precise relative variations of sTEC are achievable using phase measurements on L1 and L2 frequencies, yielding an accuracy of around 0.1 TECU or better. However, CubeSats like Spire LEMUR, with simpler setups (e.g., patch antennas) and code noise in the order of several meters, face limitations in accuracy. Their precision, determined by phase observations, remains in the 0.1–0.3 TECU range. With a substantial number of observations and comprehensive coverage of lines of sight between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and GNSS satellites, global electron density can be reconstructed from sTEC measurements. Utilizing 27 satellites from various missions, including Swarm, Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On, Jason-3, Sentinel 1/2/3, COSMIC-2, and Spire CubeSats, a cubic B-spline expansion in magnetic latitude, magnetic local time, and altitude is employed to model the logarithmic electron density. Hourly snapshots of the three-dimensional electron density are generated, adjusting the model parameters through non-linear least squares based on sTEC observations. Results demonstrate that including Spire significantly enhances estimates, showcasing exceptional agreement with in situ observations from Swarm and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program LEO satellites. The model outperforms contemporary climatological models, such as International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)-2020 and the neural network-based NET model. Validation efforts include comparisons with ground-based sTEC measurements, space-based vertical TEC from Jason-3 altimetry, and global TEC maps from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe and the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

For this purpose, a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receiver with two receive channels and a custom-built two-patch antenna are used. The SDR captures the RF signals and forwards the data to a special processing platform with a powerful SoC for data processing. During the environmental unit-level tests of the satellite's subsystems, the payload system consisting of the SDR and the processing platform was thermally characterised in a vacuum. During this characterisation, it was found that the system can be powered only for a short time due to the high power consumption causing high thermal heating. Various countermeasures were analysed and implemented to allow an operation time of more than 30 minutes, which is the intended duration of a passive reflectometry experiment.

The four element array provides a minimum gain of 2.5 dB and average gain of 5 dB compared to a single patch antenna element with a 5Wpower envelope across a range of up to 60 degrees from broadside of the array. Given the 100 mW overhead of each phased array element, the design is expected to scale to a 16 element array, which could fit on two 20 cm by 10 cm deployable panels on a 2U CubeSat.

For the Space Weather Atmospheric Reconfigurable Multiscale-EXperiment (SWARM-EX), this issue is magnified by the mission’s ambitious goals; to comply with mission requirements, a SWARM-EX spacecraft is required to concurrently (1) point the science instruments no more than 30° off ram when they are operational, (2) point the GPS patch antenna no more than 30° off zenith at least once per orbit, (3) point the boresight of the X-Band patch antenna no more than 18° from the ground station during downlink, (4) maximize the differential cross-sectional area during differential drag maneuvers, and (5) maximize solar array power generation at all times. Consequently, leading-edge CubeSat missions like SWARM-EX require innovative systems engineering solutions to remain power-positive during on-orbit operations. Through the design of a comprehensive module-based concept of operations, orbital power generation simulations, intricate constrained attitude profiles, and a configurable battery state of charge simulation tool, the SWARM-EX mission designers have conceived a plan to retire the risk of not maintaining a power-positive state while successfully meeting all mission requirements; it is the aim of the authors to illuminate these strategies as a case study.";1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

The radiometer is designed to be deployed in a CubeSat for Earth observation and weather monitoring. Its working principle relies on the nonlinearity of lithium niobate, which enables an upconversion process that boosts the microwave photon energy to the optical domain, where photodetectors are less susceptible to thermal noise at room temperature than their microwave counterparts. The key parts of the radiometer are the upconverter, which consists of an optical subsystem formed by a lithium niobate ring resonator and an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI), and an RF subsystem, which consists of two half-wavelength resonators and two patch antennas. To test the response of the former subsystem, a ring resonator and an AMZI were initially integrated into a lithium niobate photonic integrated circuit (PIC). This paper presents the experimental characterization of the optical components as well as the design and working principles of the upconverter. Regarding the optical components, we measured intrinsic quality factors of around 0.65 · 106 in the ring resonator and extinction ratios of about 20 dB in the AMZI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

The proposed antenna is designed and analyzed using the CST Microwave Studio simulation environment. The results on the antenna performance are found to be quite good. Furthermore, the contribution of the FSS structure is investigated and analyzed by mounting it on a 1U CubeSat chassis made of PEEK material.

The antenna can be mounted on the tip of the nanosatellite together with the camera, providing space for solar panels or other equipment without using additional space in the side areas. Given the limited dimensions of CubeSats, our antenna makes efficient use of the surface.

This research work presents an initial attempt to utilize these fractal properties in the design of a patch antenna, adopting a geometry that allows it to be incorporated into a standard 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm (or 1U) CubeSat. Prior to fabrication, a preliminary design was analyzed and simulated using a commercial finite element method (FEM) solver for electromagnetic structures software, High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS)™. The proposed antenna was designed at a solution frequency, f= 920 MHz and resonates well from 800 MHz to 1 GHz. The antenna was fabricated on an FR4 substrate (Formula presented). Comparison of the simulated and measured results showed a good agreement in terms of reflection coefficient and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the proposed antenna at the frequency of interest. For comparison, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) antenna was also characterized and measured. The measured peak gain of the proposed fractal antenna is at 3.148 dBi as confirmed by the radiation pattern results. It also exhibits a reflection coefficient of −26.110 dB, a VSWR of 1.104, and a wide bandwidth (BW) across the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. This type of antenna has the potential to provide a reliable link between a CubeSat and a ground sensor terminal (GST) as confirmed by the long-range communication tests.

Six years ago, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities, with one of the key thrusts being the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 meter, 35 GHz antenna in a 1.5U canister. At that time, there had been very limited development in the area of high gain CubeSat antennas which are critical for both high data rate communications and remote sensing science. A Ka-band high gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. This paper discusses the process of building, integrating, and operating the flight antenna, its final performance and lessons learned. KaPDA was an enabling technology for RainCube mission, the first Earth Science CubeSat to have an active instrument. RainCube was launched in May of 2018, making KaPDA the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat and the first of its kind to operate at Ka-band enabling a number of opportunities for high rate, deep space antenna communications and remote sensing science. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: state-of-the-art;;;;

To demonstrate the concept, an antenna prototype with right hand circular polarisation (RHCP) at C band is developed, simulated and described in this paper. Using the electronically tuneable approach on both the antenna feed and high impedance ground plane the proposed antenna is able to cover 360° in azimuth at an elevation angle of 45° with an axial ratio lower than 3 dB. Furthermore, it reports a gain of 7.9 dBi at 4.8 GHz. The antenna is shown to be capable of achieving the beam-switching by tuning the high impedance surface electronically.

The antenna array was designed at a center frequency of 5.5 GHz, and it has a two-port isolation bandwidth of 25 MHz above 20 dB while the axial ratio is below 1 dB. The main objective is to produce a four-patch antenna array to be mounted on CubeSat deployable wings along with a layer of solar panels, maximizing the usable space and obtaining a better link budget for a standardized Cubesat of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm. The orthogonal feedlines' isolation between Tx/Rx signals and a minimization of the multi-layer design provide a lower profile approach considering the state-of-the-art. The significant thickness reduction combined with a new perspective of having both deployable wings transmitting and receiving signals lead to a notable improvement of the overall system. This work is relevant due to the demand for high-performance antenna systems that may expand the capabilities of CubeSats, considering the importance of using an antenna array instead of a single element approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: state-of-the-art;;;;

Distinguished from conventional arrays formed by identical elements, the proposed one is based on sequential rotation-fed concentric annular aperture elements. By adjusting the excitation phase, magnitude, and polarization of each annular aperture element, the radiation patterns of the array can be shaped to form isoflux beams. Radiation pattern modeling method is developed to obtain array radiation parameters. Besides, to effectively characterize the impedance matching of the radiators of the array with multiple excitations, an overall reflection coefficient is deduced from signal decomposition. A prototype operating at C -band (5 GHz) is designed, fabricated, and measured. It consists of a radiator and a feeding network. The radiator is formed by two annular aperture elements, of which the inner one is realized by a circular patch antenna while the outer one is formed by eight planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs). The feeding network drives annular aperture elements in the manner of sequential rotation.

The space industry is increasingly shifting to the use of smaller spacecraft and payloads at different phases of the mission, as opposed to the traditional large systems. While the use of small satellites broadens the limits of distinct space operations in terms of size, power, cost and mass budget, they present limitations in terms of communications coverage and performance. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) offer excellent capabilities for short range applications that present high data throughput requirements. As lunar missions are being currently developed as means to do preliminary tests for deep space exploration, small satellite-based capabilities are being considered for their tasks. Considering this increase in lunar presence, the space industry is embracing well known and widely used WLAN standards, such as the standardized and ubiquitous IEEE 802.11, to create a communications and navigation network architecture similar to terrestrial Wi-Fi networks and as robust as possible to accommodate lunar mission requirements. In this work, an antenna system design, analysis, simulation, manufacturing and testing to use 5 GHz 802.11 WLAN capabilities in lunar surface applications are presented. Antenna design simulations are performed using Ansys HFSS and the analysis of the performance of the system is evaluated using Ansys SBR+. The design considers a small satellite payload being deployed from a lunar lander with two truncated-corner probe-fed (TCPF) patch antennas in both the lander and the payload sides.

Particularly, small satellite missions for deep space exploration offer accessible and low-cost solutions to realize in-orbit testing and to settle new international collaborations for research activities. Thanks to their flexibility, fast implementation and increasing reliability, small satellites can be employed to conduct scientific exploration missions on outer planets and celestial bodies in the solar system, such as the Moon surface's observations and its craters studies. In this framework, a student team from S5Lab (Sapienza Space System and Space Surveillance Laboratory), at Sapienza University of Rome, developed the MOTHS mission (Moon Observation Through Hyperspectral Satellites). MOTHS is a 6U CubeSat Moon constellation, deployed on two orbital planes, and designed entirely using COTS components. The mission was developed with the primary objective of studying and analyzing Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLP). The importance of the mission lies in the necessity of conducting an in-depth study of the TLPs, which have thus far only been detected and analysed through observation perfonned from Earth. These phenomena are strongly related to various events happening in the Moon environment such as Argon, Radon and Polonium outgassing, making crucial their understanding for future lunar landing sites and lunar settlements establishment. The TLPs are phenomena that appear on the surface of the moon and consist of short-lived changes in light, colour and appearance on the surface of the moon, which can range from foggy patches to pennanent changes in the lunar landscape. To study the TLP and all the related effects, the MOTHS primary payload consists of a hyperspectral camera equipped with a CMOS sensor payload, which enables the detection of the TLPs and of the outgassing phenomena, specifically targeting gases such as Argon, Radon, and Polonium. Moreover, to support in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU), such as rover and lander, MOTHS is equipped with a GNSS receiver together with its integrated patch antenna as a secondary payload. This payload will enable the exploitation of the MOTHS constellation as a relay system for future lunar navigation satellite systems (LNSS). In this paper, after the description of the mission concept and the mission analysis, the satellite design will be analysed, focusing on the hyperspectral payload and the GNSS system.

Metamaterials can be incorporated into the design either as a reflective surface placed at a precise distance from the antenna or by etching unit cells onto the patch or ground plane. Given the constraints of nanosatellite applications, maintaining a gap between the metamaterial and the antenna was deemed impractical, as space debris could accumulate, potentially altering performance or causing damage. To mitigate this risk, the metamaterial unit cell was etched into the ground plane, eliminating the need for separation support and reducing the antenna's overall volume.

Its simple configuration simplifies the assembly and adjustment process with the condition of the CubeSat. The propose ISL systems will orbiting on LEO orbits (600-1000 km). On the LEO orbits often occurs an ionic rotation that commonly referred as faraday rotational effect and it can cause Polarization Loss Factor (PLF). The antenna Design use truncated patch to produce circular polarization. Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) is placed under the antenna to suppress the surface current and reduce the side lobe and back lobe.

The array can be mounted on the bottom side or on the side face of the CubeSat to communicate with the earth station or communicate with another Satellite. The proposed antenna array operated in C-band spectrum that extends from 5.9 GHz to 6.4 GHz. The proposed array is consisting of four circularly polarized antenna units (CPAUs) that were arranged in a rectangular configuration. Three T-sections power divider and four sections of quarter wavelength (QWL) microstrip lines were used to connect CPAUs together to obtain a perfect impedance matching. The CPAU is composed of a combination of two orthogonal microstrip square patch antennas with a quadratic phase between them. The proposed array achieves right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) over the operating C-band. The gains for the proposed antenna array are equal 13.14dBi, 13.8dBi, and 10.72dBi at frequencies of 5.9 GHz, 6.15 GHz, and 6.4 GHz, respectively.

The goal of this research project is to create a compact and ultra-wideband planar antenna array for satellite images remote sensing, utilizing future CubeSat-swarm communication.

This development philosophy makes it possible to realize a smaller, better, faster and cost-effective small satellite constellation with the advantage of being able to perform missions quickly through a short revisit time. Small SAR Technology Experimental Project (S-STEP) is to develop 80kg-class ultra-light weight X-band active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite constellation system with an additional function of S-band Inter Satellite Link (ISL). The mission applications are focused on observation of inland/coastal region, geological mapping, environment and disaster monitoring, marine surveillance for ship and pollution detection. The S-STEP system with unique mechanical configuration of flat platetype satellite provides a high resolution of 1 m stripmap mode, ScanSAR mode with 4 m resolution and VideoSAR mode with 1 m resolution for identification of moving target. As a SAR payload, aperture-coupled cavity-backed microstrip patch array antenna with high-gain was considered in the system design. The S-STEP has innovatively reduced the total mass of satellite by adopting design strategy of multi-functional integrated structure. For example, Transmit/Receive (TR) module for active SAR mission is also used as structural stiffener and heat dissipation radiator to guarantee a long-term image acquisition of 120 sec regardless of left and right looking mission due to a novel passive thermal design of TR module. The main feature of the system is to adopt a strategy of whole spacecraft vibration isolation to decrease the total mass of satellite by reducing the launch design load. This also contributes to reduce a development cost and schedule of the project by optimizing the conventional verification process which takes a large portion of the time and cost in entire satellite development programs. In addition, the new design concept of satellite with bus and payload integrated structure makes it possible to achieve a high-dimensional stability of the structure with SAR antenna under severe on-orbit thermal environment.

With limited space, reliable and efficient high bandwidth antenna systems are needed for current and next-generation wireless technology as well as for the revolutionary small satellites. The fifth generation of mobile communication technology promises high data rates, low latency and good spectrum efficiency. One of the key enablers of this technology is the integration of satellite technology-particularly CubeSats with terrestrial communication technologies. Next-generation antennas that can meet functional requirements for 5G and CubeSat applications are therefore of fundamental importance. These antenna systems should have large bandwidth, high gain and efficiency and be compact in size. Reconfigurable antennas can provide different configurations in terms of the operating frequency, radiation pattern and polarization. Tuning reconfigurable antennas can be done by changing the physical parameters of the antenna elements through electronic switches, optical switches and the use of meta-materials. The most popular implementation method for reconfigurable antennas for wireless and satellite communication is the electronic switching method due to its high reliability, efficiency, and ease of integration with microwave circuitry. In this article, different techniques for implementing reconfigurable and multi-band antennas are reviewed, with emphasis on two main application areas; 5G wireless communication and CubeSat application. Different reconfiguration techniques have been studied for application in various wireless communication systems such as satellite communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, cognitive radio and 5G communication. It has been found that reconfigurable antennas have favourable properties for next-generation wireless technology and small satellites.

This is crucial not only for conventional communication satellites like Geostationary Orbit (GEO) but also for those in lower orbits such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Key design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), and Side Lobe Level (SLL) for each beam. However, a challenge arises in multibeam scenarios when trying to simultaneously meet requirements for the aforementioned design factors which are reflected as uneven power distribution. This leads to over-saturation, especially in centrally located antenna elements due to the activation times per beam, commonly referred to as activation instances. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a method to balance the activation instances across antenna elements for each required beam. Our focus is on beams operating at 19 GHz on a CubeSat positioned 500 km above the Earth's surface. We introduce a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based algorithm to optimize the beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix for each antenna element. A key constraint of this algorithm is a limit on activation instances per element, which avoids over-saturation in the Radio Frequency (RF) chain. Additionally, the algorithm accommodates beam requirements such as beamwidth, SLL, pointing direction, and total available power. With the previous key design factors, the algorithm will optimize the required genes to address the desired beam characteristics and constraints. We tested the algorithm's effectiveness in three scenarios using an 8times 8 DRA patch antenna with circular polarization, arranged in a triangular lattice. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only meets the required beam pattern specifications but also ensures a uniform activation distribution across the antenna array. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

In this way, MASPA with electrically small patch, multimode resonant, and frequency scannable CP angle can be yielded. Dual-mode resonant MASPAs with flare angles of 330° on air substrate, and 270° on suspended microstrip air/F4B substrates having a profile less than 0.05-wavelength are then numerically studied and experimentally validated.

However, the low mass also restricts the functionality of a nano-satellite's payload. Typically, this would imply instruments with very low to low resolution and accuracy, essentially ruling out applications such as remote sensing. However, multiple nano-satellites can cooperate to improve the overall system performance, for example by increasing the frequency of the observations. The objective of this study is to design a radar system that can be accommodated in a nano-satellite, and investigate the feasibility of using multiples of these nano-satellites to perform high temporal resolution remote sensing. In this paper therefore, the concept of a nano-satellite sized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nano-SAR) is investigated. Nano-satellites have very constrained power and volume budgets, and there are limits to how much surface area they can unfold for use in radar. Given these constraints, a SAR system for use in a nano-satellite in a 350 km orbit was sized, and approaches to tackle the deficits in the radar link budget are proposed. When applying state-of-the-art technologies, both on the component level, as well as on an architectural level, one arrives at a closed link budget. The proposed radar system consists of a patch antenna array with a span of 1.14 m by 0.18 m, operating at a frequency of 5.8 GHz. Power amplification and phase shifting is performed on the panel, using digital radio frequency (RF) integrated Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. This results in a swath width of 60 km, with pixel sizes of 10 m in elevation direction. Given these performance values, coupled with the increased revisit times, it was obvious this radar, when flown in a larger swarm of nano-satellites, would allow faster now-casting for weather prediction. With significant investment in technology development, it could be possible to use this system for SAR interferometry, for near-real-time monitoring of fast ground deformation phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes. Other applications could lie in the field of near-real-time ship motion detection and oil spill spread detection. Many technical challenges need to be solved still and platforms need to be designed, capable of supporting this system, before this payload would be ready for deployment. Preliminary design suggests the cost of such an instrument is substantially higher than what is common for nano-satellite components. However, the potential of such a system is extremely promising, and merits further investigation.©2012 by the International Astronautical Federation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: state-of-the-art;;;;

2025;"Shim, H.; Kim, B.-G.; Bae, Y.; Kee, C.";Onboard Implementation and Validation of RTK-Based Relative Navigation System for CubeSats;This paper presents the first onboard Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)-based relative navigation system designed specifically for CubeSat rendezvous and docking missions. Traditionally applied in larger satellites, GPS-based relative navigation has been optimized for low-Earth orbit (LEO), where minimal signal interference allows precise navigation without additional sensors. However, previous systems faced limitations in real-time resolution of integer ambiguities inherent in GPS carrier-phase measurements, particularly in response to the rapidly changing satellite constellations in LEO. To overcome these issues, this paper adapts a conventional single-station RTK system for use in LEO. An efficient real-time Recursive Ambiguity Filter (RAF) is proposed to reduce the ambiguity search space, replacing the extended Kalman filter. Optimized for CubeSats with constrained computational resources, the algorithm was validated through ground-based tests using commercial GPS receivers and patch antennas. The proposed system performs real-time integer ambiguity resolution, achieving cm-level navigation accuracy and ensuring a 100% success-fix rate. Furthermore, it resolves integer ambiguities within 1 s using the CubeSat's on-board computer (OBC), marking a significant advancement in CubeSat navigation technology by enabling precise satellite positioning for rendezvous missions without requiring additional expensive hardware. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

In this framework, the use of Ka-band for communication is explored. We present the design of a stacked patch antenna working across the down-and uplink Ka-bands. Materials and geometry of the radiator have been selected by accounting for the trade-off between electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical requirements. The design of the antenna is performed with a particle swarm optimization algorithm developed to control the bandwidth and matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. Furthermore, a multiphysics thermal analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized array, mounted on a 1 U satellite, in a case-study mission. The temperature patterns in the array are evaluated during the orbital period, and the influence of the operative temperature on the antenna responses and gain was considered. We found that the thermal loads can affect the antenna matching. However, thanks to the optimized design, the proposed stacked antenna can operate from-100 ^{\circ }C to 100 ^{\circ }C, with an almost constant gain. Finally, following a damage-Tolerant approach, the level of mechanical deformation, which could be induced on the communication system, was studied. The stress analysis reveals that the stacked geometry can be used in a space mission. From the investigation of the strain and displacement field, we found a negligible impact on the antenna performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

This is particularly relevant for communication at 28 GHz, a key frequency in the mmWave spectrum, used for high-bandwidth satellite links and 5G communications. Critical design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, and Side Lobe Level (SLL) for each beam. However, in multibeam scenarios, balancing these design factors can result in uneven power distribution, leading to over-saturation in centrally located antenna elements due to frequent activations. This paper introduces a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to optimize beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix, while imposing a constraint on activation instances per element to avoid over-saturation in the Radio Frequency (RF) chain.

In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization method has been utilized for performances optimization of a MPA with parasitic elements (MPA-PE) in order to get a desirable multiband antenna for X/Ku bands CubeSat applications. GAs are capable of handling a large number of design parameters and work for optimization problems that have non-differentiable or discontinuous multi-dimensional solution spaces, making them ideal for antenna optimization.

Accordingly, the performance demand on these volume- and power-limited satellites have drastically increased in the recent years. The demand for higher data throughput capabilities has been increasing, so more CubeSats are choosing S- and X-band communication options in order to meet the increasing data rates. Due to the limitations on link margin for CubeSats, use of S- and/or X-band necessitates a higher-gain, directional antenna. The main problem is that these antennas require accurate attitude determination and pointing, which can often become power-, volume-, and cost-prohibitive for CubeSat projects. The method proposed uses a permanent magnet to passively orient the satellite antenna towards the nadir direction. For satellites contacting higher-latitude ground stations, aligning the patch antenna in the direction of the magnetic dipole is enough to acquire the ground station within its half-power beamwidth.

And it is known that during both the period of attitude adjustment after the separation and working time of a satellite, TTC (Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) are very important functions necessary for the proper operation of it. In this paper, firstly a design process of a dual-band patch antenna, which can operate at 2GHz and 2.2 GHz for TTC applications on small satellites is presented, followed by the approach of the placement optimization of the TTC patch antenna onboard for a mini-satellite. In order to obtain one better strategy, the construction of the antenna is discussed and two schemes of antennas placement are introduced. Through the results secured by electromagnetic computation, it is indicated that situating three patch antennas respectively on three adjacent walls and the forth one on the cut-off bottom corner can provide a satisfactory omni-directional radiation pattern. To reduce the complexity, a new method to conform a patch antenna on the mini-satellite is proposed by bending the antenna along one edge of the cube in a top corner. By comparison and analysis, it is concluded that one bended patch antenna can perform as well as four ordinary ones do so that it can effectively cut off the weight and volume of the spacecraft, and facilitate the feeding intricacy.

2019;"Glatre, K.; Hildebrand, L.; Charbonneau, E.; Perrin, J.; Amyotte, E.";Paving the Way for Higher-Volume Cost-Effective Space Antennas: Designing for manufacturing, assembly, integration, and test;The commercial satellite industry, which has primarily been focused on highly customized geostationary satellites, is seeing increasing interest in constellations of small satellites (smallsats) operating in nongeostationary orbits. These smallsat constellations require larger quantities of antennas that are cost-/mass-effective and compact. Ideally, this is achieved by designing for manufacturing, assembly, integration, and test (DFMAIT). Maxar Technologies Company (MDA), a global leader in antenna systems, developed its expertise through R&D, establishing itself as a key supplier for antennas on constellations such as Iridium-NEXT, O3b, and OneWeb. These capabilities range from innovative steerable antenna designs, fastener-free feedchains, 3D-printed antennas as well as automated assembly and test setups. MDA is also leveraging this acquired knowledge to develop new products for future geostationary missions. This article describes the different antenna designs developed at MDA using the DFMAIT approach and presents automated test and integration setups developed for higher-volume production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: 3D-printed;;;;

As the missions and functionalities become more complex, coupled with the popular VHF and UHF bands becoming less accessible, CubeSats have been getting pushed into using higher frequency bands. For more capable CubeSats such as NASA and military satellites, utilization of S- and X-band communication have become a common place. While S- and X-band communication provide much higher data rate for the mission, the power and attitude control demand has also increased. Meeting this increased cost and demand on resources may not be feasible for university-level projects as attitude control systems can often cost more than the rest of the CubeSat. This research revisits passive magnetic pointing as an option for providing antenna pointing capability for CubeSats, enabling S- and X-band communication without requiring an active attitude control system. CubeSats can make contact with ground stations located at higher latitude to establish data link with directional antennas. The analyses shows that a higher data throughput can be achieved using S- and X-band communication over the traditional 9600 bps link with the proposed setup, without requiring active attitude control or deployable solar panels.

The main problem of common Microstrip patch antennas is that they only operate at one or two frequencies, restricting the number of bands that equipment is capable of supporting. Another issue is that, due to the very strict space that a solar panel has, setting up more antenna array is very difficult. To reduce these problems, the use of fractal shaped antennas integrated on solar cells will be analyzed.

2022;"Di Roberto, R.; Graziani, F.; Brandolini, E.";Performances of a Low-Cost Commercial GNSS receiver in LEO;Small-Satellite missions are slowly closing the gap with bigger space missions in terms of performances and value-added data. A greater number of companies are basing their analyses on data sourced from CubeSat constellations, which in turn require an adequate level of navigation precision for data geotagging and for constellation housekeeping maneuvers, to maintain the required relative geometry. Miniaturization and the advancement of consumer electronics are also increasing performances of commercial components, with navigation Systems-on-a-Chip now able to receive and process data from most navigation constellations simultaneously, thus increasing the overall fixing precision. GAUSS has been developing, manufacturing, and launching micro-satellites since 2000. One of the company's objectives is the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, instead of space-grade elements, to lower mission costs, as well as gaining valuable insights on the space effectiveness of such items. GAUSS' latest satellite, launched on March 22nd, 2021, included several original subsystems developed specifically for this and future missions. A GPS navigation subsystem based on a low-cost, COTS element was designed and employed in UNISAT-7 mission. It was conceived using lean-satellite philosophy, with a swift development, assembly, and testing phase. The first prototype's 3D fix in LEO orbital conditions was accomplished in GAUSS' RF laboratory, using a multi-satellite GPS signal simulator developed using software-defined-radios and open-source software. An increment in reliability of the flight subsystem was assured by a selective, manual revision and strengthening of critical elements on the electronic board, to mechanically secure key components and guarantee an endurance level suitable for space conditions. The system was then verified in TVAC and during environmental test sessions at flight qualification levels. The GNSS receiver was coupled with a COTS L1 active microstrip antenna, typically employed on civilian aviation leisure aircraft, and low-loss RF cables. The system was activated days after the release in orbit of UNISAT-7 and first 3D fix occurred shortly after its cold start in space. System performances were verified against 3D positions calculated using NORAD two-line-elements (TLE) and SGP4 propagators. An algorithm was implemented at ground to recreate a TLE based on several fix data obtained by the system in space, to pose the grounds for an automated computation of TLEs directly in space, on next GAUSS' small-satellite missions. This work will delve into ground testing, customized board preparation for flight, IOD mission and comparative results between the data sourced from the boarded GNSS solution and NORAD TLE orbital data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

Moreover, by co-design and including air vias (AVs) for the surface-wave aperture, the structure becomes semi-transparent and can be positioned on top of solar panels, and this can improve solar power harvesting capabilities. Structure excitation is made possible by a leaky T-junction dual-feeder using substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, creating a uniform wavefront that propagates through a truncated parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) section. In addition, a matching section based on an array of subwavelength printed patches is also included at the interface between the PPW and the grounded dielectric slab (GDS), while the AV section is positioned between the GDS and air region to improve antenna radiation. These features allow for an efficient and compact aperture, and findings are competitive compared to other relevant structures. For instance, the measured prototype demonstrated a peak realized gain (RG) of 17.5 dBi at 18.6 GHz, as well as high radiation efficiency and sidelobe levels (SSLs) of about −10 dB. This makes the SWA suitable for high data rate downlink communications when nondeployable designs are required on CubeSats, for example, or wherever a low-profile, simple, and planar antenna is needed with radiation directly at endfire. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

In small satellites however, this subsystem is often overlooked, either due to consideration of weight or available space. Using traditional design approach is not feasible and does not offer any significant benefits. With increasing availability of ""Commercial Off the Shelf"" (COTS) components in S and higher bands it is now possible to design Antenna and RF subsystem which comply with given requirements. Space is a vast unexplored territory and it is important not to lose track and control of a satellite. As payloads become more demanding in terms of bandwidth requirements it is desirable to have a high data rate communication link. This calls for use of more directive and narrower beamwidth antennas with sufficient bandwidth. On the contrary, for the purpose of tracking and identification it is preferred to have a less directive and wider beamwidth antennas. Therefore, such an antenna subsystem is required that can address solution for this problem.

This reconfiguration mechanism allows for effective miniaturization, particularly at lower frequencies, without altering the overall physical dimensions of the antenna. Each additional fractal iteration results in a shift of the resonance towards lower frequencies, a behavior that is exploited to maintain compactness while achieving dual-band functionality.

A maximum of a 30 min time span from the random events occurrence to its data download is imposed; therefore, the Iridium Constellation has been selected as a continuously in-sight network for GRB occurrence data transfer, and satellites have been equipped with the due modem and antenna. No matter of GRBs occurrence, a 1 Gb/day scientific data volume is expected, therefore an S-band link is also part of the telecommunication architecture for the mission. It is also exploited for the service module space-to-ground data exchange, in nominal phases. HERMES is also equipped with a deployable omnidirectional antenna to support LEOP and contingency phases with the UHF/VHF bands. All that reflects in two patches antenna for the S-Band and transceivers for S and low-frequency bands respectively (SkyLabs products). The ground segment leans on two mission-devoted ground stations at Malindi (Kenya) and Katherine (Australia), both using a 3-meter dish and a UHF/VHF Yagi antennae system. The paper goes through the incremental approach adopted to test the whole telecom architecture for flight. First, the Iridium EM modem is operated through AT commands using serial communication, while the EM transceivers are tested with the provider's testing software. Then, the focus moved to each board interface with the main on-board computer (OBC) verification and testing, through the framework of Flight Software Development Kit (FSDK-Bright Ascension) HERMES adopts, which emulates the flight SW to run on the OBC. A Universal Software Radio Peripheral is used to assess the quality of the antennae communication, comparing a cabled with the antennae transmission. A further verification occurred on the space2ground link, exploiting the S-band C3S ground station in Hungary to validate the packets content simulating losses. Currently, the telecom boards, connected to the OBC, are undergoing testing for some basic routines without manual control. The next step sees the whole telecom test plan to run on the HERMES FlatSat before assembly and integration. Lessons learnt, issues and solutions along the adopted test plan will be discussed in depth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.";0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
2021;"Creed, L.; Graham, J.; Jenkins, C.; Díaz Riofrío, S.D.; Wilson, A.R.; Vasile, M.";STRATHcube: The Design of a CubeSat for Space Debris Detection Using In-Orbit Passive Bistatic Radar;There is a growing need to detect, track and catalogue space debris in the congested Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region. A method to detect debris could be to use space-based passive bistatic radar (PBR). The STRATHcube project proposes to launch a CubeSat into LEO as a PBR technology demonstrator where a signal processing algorithm developed at the University of Strathclyde to detect space debris will be tested. The concept involves a radar receiver and antenna on-board a CubeSat orbiting at a low altitude to detect the radio signals transmitted by operational satellites orbiting at higher altitudes. These signals may have been modified by an object orbiting between the operational satellites and the CubeSat and therefore would indicate a piece of debris exists. This paper will present the integration of PBR technology onto a CubeSat as a payload on the STRATHcube mission and discuss the challenges faced due to the limitations of the small platform. The use of a custom-built 3D antenna and an off-the-shelf patch antenna are investigated as design options for the payload. A high-level design for each option was completed to evaluate their capabilities on the size of trackable debris and to determine their mass and power parameters. After an extensive trade-off analysis at a system level, carried out to narrow down the options of the PBR payload on the CubeSat platform, it was determined that the patch antenna option presented the best way of facilitating the experiment onboard the CubeSat due to its small size and mass. The completed design of the STRATHcube mission will enable an in-orbit demonstration of the PBR technology, which if successful, will provide an alternative to conventional ground-based tracking that is cheaper and more available to the space community. This method would then be proven to industry who can use this approach to implement on a larger scale in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;1;INCLUDED: All concepts present (Microstrip_Antenna_Patch=YES, Cubesat_Small_Satellite=YES).

2024;"MacHida, M.; Tomura, T.; Sakamoto, H.; Fukao, T.";Stretchable-Substrate-Impregnated Fabric: Deployable Reflectarray Antennas for CubeSats;"This paper proposes a stretchable-substrate-impregnated fabric for deployable high-gain antenna for small satellites. Constellations of small satellites offer worldwide coverage of wireless communication and earth observation; high-gain antennas are required to realize high-speed communication and high-resolution radar. This paper aims to develop a CubeSat onboard high-gain reflectarray antenna that can be folded compactly and deployed in space. The novelty of this paper is the stretchable-substrate-impregnated fabric, which can realize low stowage volume with high fabrication tolerance and low resistivity with single-piece reflectarray to avoid gain degradation. The origami-folding-pattern compatible reflection elements can avoid creases on the elements, avoiding gain reduction after folding. A 17× 17 -element reflectarray using the stretchable-substrate-impregnated fabric and the origami-folding-pattern compatible reflection elements is designed, fabricated, and characterized. The folded volume of the reflectarray is 27 mm in height and 58 mm in diameter, and the measured fabrication tolerance of the reflection element was 20 ~μ m at most. Electrical antenna measurements confirmed low resistivity of 1.20 mΩ /Box and a high realized gain of 23.6 dBi, comparable with conventional flexible printed circuit reflectarray antennas. The simulated and measured antenna efficiency is 25.3% and 25.1%, respectively. The simulated and measured 1-dB gain down bandwidth is 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.";0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: reflectarray;;;;

Deployable antennas offer a solution to achieve large antenna apertures, while allowing to stow the aperture during the launch process. This paper presents a novel deployment mechanism based on embedded dielectric thread, and studies the effects of this thread in the performance of the metasurface elements of the deployable antenna. The proposed hinge mechanism minimizes gaps created by traditional hinges, ensuring structural integrity and RF performance. Direct light processing is used to manufacture the channelized metasurface elements which are metalized using silver conductive pastes. Experimental results show that the channelized structure introduces minimal phase variation of 1.15% (1.92°) and 0.139 dB of added loss at 30 GHz, making it suitable for use with deployable reflectarrays in space applications. This work validates the usage of embedded channels in the dielectric of metasurface antennas, and presents results that can be used to adjust the antenna geometry to account for the effects of such channels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
2021;"Yekan, T.; Baktur, R.";Study of the Impact between a Triple Junction Space Solar Cell and the Antenna Integrated on Top of It;Solid and meshed patch antennas integrated on the cover glass of a commercial space solar cell were examined. The effect of the solar cell on the antenna was analyzed and validated. The impact of the antenna on the efficiency of the solar cell was quantified through experiments. It has been found that while the active semiconductor junction in a solar cell severely reduces the gain of the antenna in many space communication bands, the electrode lattice in the solar cell can potentially act as an isolation between the solar cell and the antenna, preventing the gain worsening. The effect of the lattice also promises a potential application in lab-grown solar cells such that one may carefully design the size and number of the electrodes to ensure the best gain for the integrated antenna. The main factor that impacts the efficiency of the solar cells was found to be the cover glass rather than the shadow from the antenna. These results can serve as design guidelines when integrating optically transparent antennas on solar panels of small satellites to reduce payload and to achieve reliable communication link. One may balance the selection of solar cells, cover glass, and antenna geometry to achieve the optimal link budget. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch, Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;

Unfortunately, such a design does not exist as current CubeSat high gain antennas have focused on S-band. JPL has initiated a research and technology development effort to design a half-meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (10 cm × 10 cm × 15 cm) and provide 42dB of gain (50% efficiency). The KaPDA design must solve conflicting mechanical requirements on surface accuracy, stowed space, and ability to deploy. The development of a conceptual design that satisfies each requirement is discussed in this paper. The design uses folding ribs to fit in the stowage space, deep rib sections with precision hinges to maintain surface accuracy, and a combination of an innovative inflating bladder and springs to deploy the antenna. RF simulations show that after losses, KaPDA would have about 42 dB gain, at 50% efficiency. KaPDA would create opportunities for a host of new CubeSat missions by allowing high data rate communication which would enable using data intensive instruments or venturing further into deep space, including interplanetary missions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Contains exclusion keywords: state-of-the-art;;;;

Despite the ongoing standardization efforts within the space community, the unique payload requirements of the AcubeSAT mission, an open-source nanosatellite that aims to probe the effects of radiation and microgravity on eukaryotic cells in Low Earth orbit (LEO) within the FYS3 program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office, necessitated the development of a custom, cost-effective module. This module shall not only meet the spatial and functional demands of the mission but also serve as an educational tool, providing valuable hands-on experience to project members involved in designing space-grade equipment and developing critical system software that follow the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) Standard. The single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) hosts two distinct subsystems: one resembling a conventional OBC responsible for telecommand execution, telemetry fetching, onboard time synchronization, in-orbit patching, and Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR). The second entails the implementation of an Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) for both nominal and downlinking scenarios, facilitating a directional patch antenna for payload data transmission. The hardware for each subsystem resides on separate sides of the PCB and includes non-volatile memories for critical data and telemetry storage, custom radiation-tested Latch-up Current Limiter (LCL) protection circuits, sensors, interfaces with the Payload Subsystem, the actuators and the rest of the in-house and Commercial of the Shell (COTS) components, all while maintaining compatibility with the LibreCube standard. At the core of each subsystem lies a Radiation Tolerant Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) Cortex-M7 MCU. This architecture not only decentralizes processing power, mitigating single points of failure but also leverages redundancy capabilities. This paper aims to elucidate the decision-making process, design iterations, and development stages of the custom board and accompanying in-house software.

The proposed MTS antennas are comprehensively analyzed using impedance layer models with Sommerfeld-type integrals and image theory. The proposed MTS can function as a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), perfect electrical conductor (PEC), or reactive impedance surface (RIS) depending on the conditions. In high-gain configurations, the MTS antenna is 26.5 x 26.5 x 2.52 mm3 and achieves a peak boresight gain of 10.1 dBi at 9 GHz under PMC, with boresight gain reduction observed at 11 GHz as it transitions toward PEC. The −10-dB impedance bandwidth exceeds 25%, covering the 6.7 ∼ 8.7 -GHz range. For wide-beamwidth applications, the antenna is 16.5 x 16.5 x 3.04 mm3 and incorporates an RIS to mitigate ground plane effects, resulting in a 3-dB beamwidth of 140° (H-plane) and 104° (E-plane).

The satellite offers numerous payloads alongside the satellite bus, all of which might be used by an OPS-SAT experiment. The unpredictable nature of experiments with respect to the use of payload components raises certain unknowns, in particular concerning power consumption. As a result, the thermal behaviour throughout the satellite depends largely on which of the several on-board experiments and the associated payloads are switched on. OPS-SAT offers a variety of communication modules, such as a UHF transceiver, an S-Band transceiver, a Software Defined Radio (SDR), an X-Band transmitter and an optical receiver. The peak power consumption of OPS-SAT may exceed 30 watts during high power experiments. The S-Band transceiver consumes up to 10 watts during ground station passes and the so-called Satellite Experimental Processing Platform (SEPP), the heart of OPS-SAT experiments, consumes up to 8 watts constantly. This work provides an overview of the design and the thermal considerations on OPS-SAT and the results of the thermal vacuum (TVAC) test campaign. The results yield an average thermo-optical emissivity of 0.79 to 0.84 and the thermal power distribution on the spacecraft surface, and demonstrate the special case of the thermally isolated S-Band and X-Band patch antennas. Based on the derived results, predictions can be made about the thermal behaviour during various load cases and during periods with an active S-Band transmitter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;

It uses UHF for uplink and VHF for downlink. The CubeSat is a technology demonstrator and the needs of the six payloads are very different, with two communications payloads (a demonstrator S-band radio and patch antenna, and FL'Ncube-2), two with novel hardware from industrial groups and two with hardware for scientific applications from university groups. The Ground Segment allows the needs of the different payloads to be addressed, commanding to be pre-planned and tested using a software simulator, and some processing (and checking) of the data and housekeeping is performed before the data is distributed to the payload providers. The flexibility provided by the custom-built Ground Segment proved invaluable, since its modular design meant that an alternative method of communicating with the satellite could be inserted into the system when the original end-To-end system was found to have issues, and as new methods of operation were designed they could be included in the command uplink and downlink chain.

To adapt the algorithm to the CubeSat platform and apply centimeter-level relative navigation using only single-frequency measurements commonly available in GPS receivers for CubeSat, various performance degradation issues arise due to constraints imposed by the onboard systems, such as limited power, computing resources, and redundancy assurance. Therefore, when applying GPS-based precise relative navigation to CubeSat missions for autonomous formation flying and rendezvous docking, it is essential to consider the performance impact resulting from the hardware characteristics of the onboard computer, space GPS receiver, and GPS antenna. The relative navigation algorithm used in this application is developed based on a software GPS simulator in a LEO environment. Before validating the algorithm for satellite deployment, ground validation must be prioritized. In other words, understanding the differences between the LEO and ground environments and establishing a sequential verification procedure for the relative navigation algorithm are required. For this purpose, we aim to validate the developed precision relative navigation algorithm for CubeSats incrementally using measurements collected on the ground and analyze the actual hardware characteristics to achieve algorithm verification goal. To validate the utility of the proposed technique, we first verify the effectiveness of the developed CubeSat RTK relative navigation algorithm.

2017;"Arnaud, E.; Menudier, C.; Fouany, J.; Mońedìere, T.; Thèvenot, M.";X-band compact dual circularly polarized isoflux antenna for nanosatellite applications;This paper presents an original solution to design a compact dual circularly polarized isoflux antenna for nanosatellite applications. This kind of antenna has been previously designed in our laboratory, for a single circular polarization. This antenna is composed of a dual circularly polarized feed and a choke horn antenna. This feed is a cross-shaped slot in the ground plane, which provides coupling between a patch and a ring microstrip line with two ports. It is located at the center of a choke horn antenna. The simulated antenna presents an axial ratio,3 dB and a realized gain close to 0 dB over a 400 MHz bandwidth (8.0-8.4 GHz) at the limit of coverage, i.e. 658 whatever the azimuth angle (w) and the port. A 20 dB matching for each port and 13 dB isolation characteristics between the two ports have been achieved on this bandwidth. It has been realized and successfully measured. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
2019;"Squadrito, P.; Zhang, S.; Pedersen, G.F.";X-Band Dual Circularly Polarized Patch Antenna with High Gain for Small Satellites;This paper presents an X-band circularly polarized patch antenna with a simulated high gain of 12.5 dBi and a simulated side-lobe-level of below -20 dB, within the bandwidth of 5.2%. This single element antenna achieves high gain by exploiting the mode superposition of TM<inf>11</inf> + TM<inf>13</inf> (excited by a circle of vias loading the cavity) and TM<inf>12</inf> + TM<inf>14</inf> (excited by the cavity itself) radiated from the two apertures, respectively. A simple feeding network, consisting of a quadrature hybrid and a couple of 90° bent branches, is used in the design to excite RHCP or LHCP mode in the antenna cavity. A capacitive disk feeding is implemented so that the antenna can be matched to the feeding network, and the super-positioned fields inside the cavity are not disturbed by the feeding pins. This approach makes the design of a dual-sense circularly polarized antenna with high gain easier since the array configuration is not needed. High gain, in combination with a dual-sense circular polarization, makes the proposed antenna particularly attractive for space applications involving small satellites. With the proposed design, it is possible to employ only one antenna rather than two (RHCP and LHCP), thus saving space on the aircraft, which is clearly a limited resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Cubesat_Small_Satellite;;;;
2022;"Chen, G.; Hu, C.; Wei, M.; Zhang, J.; Lin, F.";X-Band Low-Profile Wideband Circular Polarized Microstrip Array for CubeSat Communications;This paper proposes a novel circular polarized microstrip array with high gain for satellite communication in X-band. In order to extend the impedance bandwidth, the novel single-feed unit element is created without adding the profile. The proposed antenna employs the sequential rotation technique to improve the axial ratio bandwidth with high circular polarization purity. The final design, with an overall size of 91.6 mm x 45.8 mm×1.7 mm is simulated. The proposed antenna can provide an impedance bandwidth of 62.1% from 8.83 GHz to 16.78 GHz, and 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth from 9.84 GHz to 11.52 GHz. The realized gain at the center frequency is 16.4 dBi (with 3-dB gain in band ranging from 9.70 GHz to 12.18 GHz, covering the whole axial ratio bandwidth). Thus, the proposed low-profile circular polarized antenna is suitable for X-band satellite applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
2021;"Di Martino, G.; Di Simone, A.; Iodice, A.; Riccio, D.; Ruello, G.; Grassi, M.; Graziano, M.D.; Moccia, A.; Renga, A.";X-Band SAR Antenna Design for a CubeSat Formation-Flying Remote Sensing Mission;This paper presents the design of the receiving antenna of an upcoming formation-flying synthetic aperture radar (FF-SAR) based on the CubeSat standard and on a preexisting spaceborne SAR of opportunity. The receiving antenna operates at X-band and is compliant with the imaging modes of the FF-SAR, namely a stripmap mode for signal-To-noise ratio improvement (IM1) and a High-Resolution Wide-Swath mode for the monitoring of large areas (IM2). A large reflector has been designed to meet the high-gain requirement in IM1, while the wide coverage needed in IM2 is ensured by a reconfigurable patch array feed. Full-wave analysis shows that the designed receiving antenna achieves 37.42 dBi gain in IM1 and 12.1 degree half-power beamwidth in IM2. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;0;EXCLUDED: Missing required concepts: Microstrip_Antenna_Patch;;;;
